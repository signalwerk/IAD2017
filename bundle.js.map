Diese Schrift wurde im Jahr 1907/1908 entwickelt und hatte das Ziel die Effizienz der Satzherstellung zu steigern, besonders bei Zeitschriften und Zeitungen.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../img/specimen/BibSG/Cover.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"../img/specimen/BibSG/Inhalt.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"../img/specimen/BibSG/Schriftmuster.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\"></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"offizin-haag-drugulin\\\">Offizin Haag-Drugulin</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h3>Inhaltliche Teile</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Inhaltsverzeichnis ist nach Einsatz der Schriften und Schriftart unterteilt</li>\\n<li>Als Einstieg einen Einblick in die Geschichte der Schrift</li>\\n<li>Dann folgen die Schriftmuster.

Ausgabegerät in eine Pixel-Matrix umgesetzt werden müssen. Diese Umrechnung von Vektoren zu Pixel kann auf verschiedene Arten geschehen. Die dafür zuständige Software wird Renderer genannt und ist je nach Hersteller unterschiedlich und liefert für die selben Vektoren unterschiedliche Ergebnisse.</p>\\n<h3>Grösse in Pixel</h3>\\n<p>Die Darstellungsgrösse einer Schrift wird in PPM (pixels per em) gemessen. Also wie viele Pixel das Geviert (vertikaler Raumbedarf) einnimmt. Wird also ein Font auf eine Schriftgrösse von 20 Pixel eingestellt, so ist der vertikale Raumbedarf 20 Pixel hoch. Das effektive Schriftbild (Schwärzung) ist jedoch im allgemeinen kleiner und von Schrift zu Schrift verschieden. Siehe <a href=\\\"../font-anatomy/\\\">Fonts · Eigenschaften</a>.\\nEine Fontdatei hat intern ein ein Koordinatensystem, welches sich in Einheiten pro Geviert berechnet bei PostScript-basierten Schriften ist dies meist 1000 UPM (units per em) und bei TrueType-basierten Schriften meist 2048 UPM.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"col_6of12\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"grid w80p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/normal/Arial_a_outline.png\\\" alt=\\\"Buchstabe a als Outline\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>Font als Outline</h4>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"col_6of12_last\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"grid w80p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/normal/Arial_a_no_hint.png\\\" alt=\\\"Buchstabe a als Pixel ohne Hinting\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>12 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – S/W</h4>\\n<p>Gerendert werden alle Pixel die zu mindestens\\n50% innerhalb der Kontur liegen (ohne Hinting).</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<h3>Auflösung</h3>\\n<p>Je höher die Auflösung eines Buchstaben ist, um so klarer nähert sich die Pixel-Darstellung an die Vektorform an.\\nEine höhere Auflösung pro Buchstabe kann erreicht werden, indem die Grösse des Buchstabens oder die Auflösung des Ausgabegeräts erhöht wird.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize upscale\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_a_waterfall@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Arial as in s/w gerendert\\\"></p>\\n<h4>8 bis 48 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h4>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"darstellung-ohne-graustufen\\\">Darstellung ohne Graustufen</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"grid w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_word_waterfall_8_18px@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Textworte in Arial als s/w in 8–18px mit Microsoft Renderer\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h3>8 bis 18 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h3>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Bei kleinen Schriften oder aber bei gewissen Display-Technologien kann es sinnvoll sein, Schrift nur mit S/W darzustellen.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid upscale\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_Hamburge_8px@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Textwort in Arial als s/w in 8px mit Microsoft Renderer\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h3>8 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h3>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid upscale\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_Hamburge_24px@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Textwort in Arial als s/w in 24px mit Microsoft Renderer\\\"></p>\\n<h3>24 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h3>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Unterschiede im Rendering</h3>\\n<p>Bei der S/W-Darstellung von Schrift sind die Unterschiede zwischen verschiedenen Renderern viel weniger stark erkennbar als bei einer Darstellung mit Graustufen.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"col_4of12\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/FreeType_BW_Arial_a_13px@100x.png\\\" alt=\\\"a in Arial als s/w in 13px mit FreeType Renderer – 2014\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>FreeType-Renderer – S/W</h4>\\n<p>13 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"col_4of12\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_a_13px@100x.png\\\" alt=\\\"a in Arial als s/w in 13px mit Microsoft Renderer – 2014\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>MS-Renderer – S/W</h4>\\n<p>13 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"col_4of12_last\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Apple_BW_Arial_a_13px@100x.png\\\" alt=\\\"a in Arial als s/w in 13px mit Apple Renderer – 2014\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>Apple-Renderer – S/W</h4>\\n<p>13 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"hinting\\\">Hinting</h2>\\n<p>Über spezielle Instruktionen wird die Kontur einer Schrift so verformt, dass die Darstellung besser auf ein Pixel-Grid passt.

Zu Wörtern und Sätzen zusammengestellt vermitteln sie eine Aussage, die nicht nur inhaltlich, sondern auch optisch beinfluss- und manipulierbar sind. Die Buchstaben sind die Einzelteile des Alphabets und repräsentieren einen einzelnen Laut (Phonem) der menschlichen Sprache. Die Versalformen (Grossbuchstaben) basieren auf der Römischen Kapitalis (in Stein geschlagene Schrift), das gemeine Alphabet (Kleinbuchstaben) auf der Weiterentwicklung dieser Formen (karolingische Minuskel, humanistische Minuskel). Der Buchstabe als visuelles Zeichen der Sprache hat vorwiegend bei der Darstellung oder Übermittlung von Botschaften eine Bedeutung. Nur in seltenen Fällen, wird auch im gesprochenen Kontext auf Buchstaben zurückgegriffen (Buchstabieren).</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"romische-capitalis-monumentalis\\\">Römische Capitalis Monumentalis</h2>\\n<p>Die Capitalis Monumentalis ist eine der wichtigsten römischen Schriften aus der Antike. Sie wird auch als Lapidarschrift bezeichnet, da sie vorwiegend mit Pinsel auf Stein (lateinisch lapis = Stein) geschrieben wurde und dann die form aus dem Stein gemeisselt. Sie gilt massgebend für die Formgebung der heutigen Grossbuchstaben. Die Capitalis Monumentalis besteht nur aus Grossbuchstaben (Versalschrift) und beinhaltet noch nicht alle heutezutage gebräuchlichen Schriftzeichen.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/capitalis/capitalis_monumentalis.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\">\\nRömisches Nationalmuseum in den Thermen des Diolektian, Rom</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"karolingische-minuskel\\\">Karolingische Minuskel</h2>\\n<p>Die karolingische Minuskel wurde zum Ende des 8. Jahrhunderts im Auftrag von Karl dem Grossen als einheitliche Buch- und Schreibschrift entwickelt. Sie gilt als massgebend für die Formgebung der heutigen Kleinbuchstaben.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/carolingianMinuscule/karolingische.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\">\\nKarolingische Minuskel, Pergament, im Kloster Reichenau Ende des 10.Jahrhunderts geschrieben worden.</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"handschrift-buchschrift\\\">Handschrift &amp; Buchschrift</h2>\\n<p>Über Jahrhunderte war es üblich Kulturgüter wie Wissen, Technik, Verträge, Gesetze oder Geschichten in eine handschriftliche Form zu überführen um diese dauerhalft zu festigen und unabhängig von Zeit und Ort zu konservieren.</p>\\n<p>Wollte man mehrere Kopien eines Buches oder einer Notiz, so beanspruchte jede «Kopie» genau gleich viel Zeit wie das erstellen des «Originals». Bücher wurden somit von Hand in Skriptorien in Klöstern (Schreibstuben) abgeschrieben. Eine Kopie mit meist aufwendigen Ausschmückungen konnte mehrere Jahre Arbeit in Anspruch nehmen.

Als Goldschmied konnte Gutenberg mit Metall umgehen und erfand ein Handgiessinstrument das es ihm ermöglicht hat, dieselben Buchstaben aus einer Legierung (mit dem Hauptanteil Blei) immer wieder zu giessen. Die so gegossenen Zeichen waren wie kleine erhabene Stempel. Dazu musste die Druckfarbe, die nun auf Bleibuchstaben haften musste, als auch eine abgeänderte Spindelpresse erfunden oder weiterentwickelt werden, um die ersten Druckprodukte mit dieser neuartigen Technik zu produzieren.\\nDiese Erfindung des Buchdruck (Hochdruckverfahren) verbreitete sich ab ~1450 ausgehend von Mainz (Deutschland) innert weniger Jahre über die ganze Welt und wurde technisch beinahe unverändert bis ins 20. Jahrhundert beibehalten.\\n~1455 erschien Gutenbergs 42-zeilige Biebel (B42), welches als erstes gedrucktes Buch mit beweglichen Bleilettern gillt. Gutenberg hatte dafür die damals übliche Textura (Schriftart) der Schreibstuben in Bleibuchstaben überführt und mit vielen verschiedenen Ligaturen und Zeichenformen das «künschtliche Schreiben» möglichst ähnlich dem damals vorherschenden Schreibstiel angepasst.</p>\\n<p>Der Wachsende Bedarf an Bedruckstoffen fürhte dazu, dass prozentual immer weniger Bücher auf Pergament gedruckt wurden. Jedoch galten bis ins 19. Jahrhundert Pergament-Bände als besonders Wertvoll.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"col_6of12\\\">\\n<h4>Johannes Gutenberg</h4>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/typesetting/gutenberg.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Johann Gensfleisch zum Gutenberg, Kupferstich nach André Thevet, 1584.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"col_6of12_last\\\">\\n<h4>Bleiletter</h4>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/typesetting/Bleiletter.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Schriftherstellung</h3>\\n<p>Für die Herstellung von Bleilettern benötigt man eine Matrize, von der man giessen kann.

Als das World Wide Web 1993 durch das CERN frei gegeben wird, war die Formatierung noch nicht durch einen Gestalter zu beeinflussen. Lediglich der Browser bestimmte das aussehen. Mit der Einführung von CSS im Jahre 1996 wurde dann die Möglichkeit geschaffen, Schriften einem Inhalt zu zuweisen. Allerdings musste der entsprechende Font bereits auf dem Zielgerät installiert sein. Bereits 1997 ermöglichte Microsoft mit damaliger Technologie in Ihrem Browser das Laden von Fonts über das Internet. Somit wurde es möglich, eigene Schriften einzusetzen. Doch diese Technologie war nur auf Internet Explorer (Windows) verfügbar und auch von den Font-Anbietern sehr schlecht akzeptiert. Erst im Jahre 2009 wurde auf Grundlage von OpenType ein neues Format namens «WOFF» (Web Open Font Format) entwickelt. Dieses Format wurde sehr schnell von Browser-Herstellern und von Font-Anbietern akzeptiert, so dass heute Problemlos auf allen wichtigen Browsern der vom Gestalter gewünschte Font dynamisch in die Seite geladen werden kann.</p>\\n<h3>Web Safe Fonts (Systemfonts)</h3>\\n<p>Unter Systemfonts wird häufig eine Auswahl an Schriften verstanden, die zu einer sehr hohen Wahrscheinlichkeit auf dem Betriebssystem installiert sind, auf dem ein Browser eine Website darstellt. Somit ist der Browser in der Lage diesen Font zu verwenden und es muss kein zusätzlicher Font übertragen werden. Die Auswahl dieser Fonts ist sehr beschränkt und variiert stark von Betriebssystem zu Betriebssystem. Um dennoch die Gestaltung mehr oder weniger unter Kontrolle zu behalten, werden in einem CSS sogenannte Fallbacks angegeben. Das heisst, wenn eine Schrift nicht vorhanden ist, so kommt eine andere zum Einsatz.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel</h4>\\n<p>CSS-Definition mit Font-Fallbacks:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\np {\\n  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<p>Es wird versucht zuerst Arial einzusetzen. Wenn keine Arial vorhanden ist, soll Helvetica zum Einsatz kommen und sonst eine beliebige Serifenlose.</p>\\n<h3>Verbreitung und Vorteile von Webfonts</h3>\\n<p>Meist kommt bei Webfonts das WOFF (Web Open Font Format) zum Einsatz. Seit 2014 sind auch die besser komprimierten WOFF 2.0 Dateien im Gebrauch, die heute von allen modernen Browsern unterstützt werden. Auch ältere Browser können mit älteren Font-Formaten (EOT)  Schriften einbinden.\\nVerfügt man über eine Lizenz eines Webfonts, so kann diese Schrift dynamisch zur Seite hinzugeladen werden. Der Gestalter weiss somit, wie seine Seite aussehen wird und kann die Typografie vollständig kontrollieren.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Fallback</h4>\\n<p>Damit der Webfont von möglichst vielen Browsern gelesen werden kann, werden diverse Fallbacks definiert.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>CSS-Definition für Webfonts:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\n@font-face {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans';\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot'); /* IE9 */\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), /* IE6 - IE8 */\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff2') format('woff2'), /* Modern Browsers */\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff') format('woff'), /* OK Browsers */\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.ttf') format('truetype'); /* Safari, Android, iOS */\\n  font-weight: normal; <!–– ** ––>\\n  font-style: normal;\\n}\\n\\np {\\n  font-family: \\\"Open Sans\\\", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h4>Beispiel google-Fonts</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans');\\n\\np {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Unicode Range</h3>\\n<p>Möchte man nur eine speziefische Auswahl an Buchstaben (Subset) eines Fonts von einer anderen Font-Datei beziehen, so kann dies mittels <code>unicode-range</code> gemacht werden. Dies ist vor allem nützlich, wenn wichtige Zeichen in einem Font fehlen (beispielsweise geschütztes schmales Leerzeichen) und von einer anderen Datei bezogen werden müssen.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel</h4>\\n<p>CSS-Definition mit <code>unicode-range</code> aus zwei font-faces:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\n@font-face {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans';\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot');\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff2') format('woff2'),\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff') format('woff'),\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.ttf') format('truetype');\\n  font-weight: normal;\\n  font-style: normal;\\n  unicode-range: U+000-5FF; /* Latin glyphs */  <!–– ** ––>\\n}\\n\\n@font-face {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans';\\n  src: url('special-web.eot');\\n  src: url('special-web.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),\\n  url('special-web.woff2') format('woff2'),\\n  url('special-web.woff') format('woff'),\\n  url('special-web.ttf') format('truetype');\\n  font-weight: normal;\\n  font-style: normal;\\n  unicode-range: U+0061; /* overwrite for letter a */  <!–– ** ––>\\n}\\n\\np {\\n  font-family: \\\"Open Sans\\\", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h3>OpenType features</h3>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Links</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://helpx.adobe.com/typekit/using/open-type-syntax.html#ordn\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Übersicht über die OpenType-Features von Adobe</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/font-feature-settings/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Anwendung – css-tricks</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">MDN</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://blog.bramp.net/post/2018/01/21/google-font-features/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Google vs. Font Features</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n<p>Auch im Web sind OpenType features wie Ligaturen oder verschiedenen Zahlensets möglich.

Adobe, Google, Microsoft und Andere haben zugesagt diesen Standard bald in Ihre Software-Produkte zu integireren. Neben diversen eher technischen Erneuerungen ist vor allem die Möglichkeit für «Variable Fonts» für Gestalter heraus zu streichen. Mit dieser Funktion können Fonts mehrere so genannte Design-Achsen haben. Man kann also Fonts so einrichten, dass Sie zum Beispiel von ganz Light zu super Black stuffenlos (oder mit vom Designer gewählten Stufen) einstellbar sind. Aber auch andere Design-Achsen lassen sich frei vom Schriftdesinger bestimmen. Diese Technologie erinnert an die «Multiple master fonts» (1991), jedoch wird sich der neue Standard wohl besser verbreiten als die damalige Technologie.</p>\\n<h3>CSS und Web</h3>\\n<p>Im Moment werden Variable Fonts gerade in die Software-Produkte eingebaut. Erste Test-Versionen sind für Entwickler zugägnlich. Folgende CSS-Attribute sind vom Standard vorgesehen:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>font-weight</code> – Schriftstärke als Zahl von 1–999</li>\\n<li><code>font-stretch</code> – Schriftbreite in % (50% = Condesed, 200% Extended)</li>\\n<li><code>font-style</code> – Schriftlage zwischen -90° und +90°</li>\\n<li><code>font-optical-sizing</code> – Optische Schriftgrösen ein- oder ausschalten</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br>\\n<p>Daneben lassen sich aber auch weitere Werte-Achsen wie folgt definieren;</p>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<p>Hier wird jeweils eine Werte-Achse mit vier Buchstaben (vom Designer bestimmt) mit einem Wert angewandt.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\np {\\n    font-variation-settings: \\\"wdth\\\" 600, \\\"wght\\\" 200, \\\"opsz\\\" 48;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"fonts-finden-testen\\\">Fonts finden &amp; testen</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Mieten von Desktop-Fonts</h4>\\n<p>Auf fontstand.com können Desktop-Fonts gemietet werden. Dies ermöglicht Entwürfe dem Kunden vor zu legen, ohne den Font gekauft zu haben.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Fonts für Web- und Screendesign können von fast allen grossen und kleinen Font-Foundrys erworben werden. Es gibt vereinzelt Schriften, die (noch) nicht für den Web-Einsatz lizenziert werden können, dies ist jedoch eher die Ausnahme. Für Anwendungen ausserhalb des Webs – aber auf Screens – gibt es eher wenige Anbieter. So bietet zum Beispiel Linotype auch für eBooks, Apps und Server-Anwendungen Lizenzen. Diese Lizenztypen sind jedoch bei anderen Firmen oft nur mit Verhandlungen zu erwerben und es gibt keine standardisierten Prozesse.\\nDas Vorgehen zur Recherche von neuen Schriften unterscheidet sich nicht wesentlich vom finden von Schriften für den Print-Bereich. Sucht man eine Schrift, deren Name schon bekannt ist, so kann direkt zum Anbieter gesprungen werden. Ist man eher auf der Suche nach einem bestimmten Stil, kann eine Font-Plattform wie myfonts.com genutzt werden um ein entsprechendes Design zu finden.</p>\\n<h3>Testen</h3>\\n<p>Beim Suchen von Schriften ist es ratsam, die Schrift möglichst in einem Live-Preview auf die Tauglichkeit am Bildschirm zu prüfen. Deshalb können Fonts bei immer mehr Anbietern entweder auf der Seite getestet werden, oder aber Sie kooperieren mit Test-Platformen wie zum Beispiel typecast.com. Bei solch einem Dienst kann bereits vor dem Kauf geprüft werden, ob die Schrift bei gewünschter Anwendung, Grösse und Schriftmischung auf dem Screen funktioniert.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h3>Vor dem Kauf testen</h3>\\n<p>Auf typecast.com können Text-Layouts bereits vor dem Kauf einer Schrift definiert und editiert werden.\\nDies erleichtert die Wahl eines geeigneten Fonts und zudem kann dem Kunden bereits ein Eindruck der fertigen Site vermittelt werden.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"imageline\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/typecast.png\\\" alt=\\\"Fonts mit typecast.com testen\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"fontlizenzen\\\">Fontlizenzen</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Mieten (pro Monat)</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.fonts.com/unlimited#pricing\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">fonts.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://typekit.com/plans\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Typekit</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Fonts einmalig kaufen</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.urwpp.de/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">→ URW++</a> (zeitlich beschränkt)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.fontshop.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">→ Fontshop</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Views kaufen</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.linotype.com/de/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">→ linotype.com</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n<p>Es gibt grundsätzlich drei verschiedene Arten von kommerziellen Font-Lizenzen:</p>\\n<h3>Miet-Lizenzen</h3>\\n<p>Beim mieten von Lizenzen wird meist ein View-Volumen pro Monat gekauft unabhängig jedoch von der Anzahl der Fonts. So kann zum Beispiel bei fonts.com ein Account erworben werden, der 50 000 Pageviews pro Monat auf einer Domain erlaubt. Wird diese Zahl überschritten, muss auf ein höherer Preisplan gewechselt werden. Oft kann ein Account für diverse Projekte gleichzeitig verwendet werden. Die Fonts sind beim Anbieter gehostet.</p>\\n<h3>Einmalige Lizenzkosten</h3>\\n<p>Bei immer wenigen Anbietern kann eine Lizenz einmalig erworben werden. Bei einer solchen Lizenz wird diee Schrift meist auf dem eigenen Server installiert und der Schriftenanbieter vertraut darauf, dass der Käufer die Anzahl Views pro Monat, für die Lizenziert wurde, nicht überschritten wird.</p>\\n<h3>Kaufen von Views</h3>\\n<p>Es gibt Anbieter, die Views verkaufen. Das heisst, dass mit jedem Besuch einer Webseite mit dem Font das erworbene «Konto» um ein View reduziert wird. Somit muss die Schrift von Zeit zu Zeit wieder mit neuen Views aktiviert werden, so dass immer genügend Views vorhanden sind. Oder aber das Konto erneuert sich immer am Ende des Monats neu.</p>\\n<h3>Zeichensatz</h3>\\n<p>Wird die Schrift auf einer Seite eingesetzt, bei der viele Sprachen oder sonst spezielle Zeichen vorkommen, so ist es empfehlenswert zu Prüfen, ob die Schrift auch den nötigen Zeichensatz abdeckt. Auch OpenType-Features werden von den Schriftherstellern normalerweise vor dem Kauf angegeben.</p>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"freefonts-kommerzielle-fonts\\\">Freefonts – Kommerzielle Fonts</h2>\\n<p>Es gibt von diversen Font Foundries, Firmen und Enthusiasten qualitativ sehr hochwertige und gute Schriften, die frei verfügbar sind. Dabei gibt es diverse Abstufungen. Es gibt ganze Schriftfamilien, die frei sind, dann gibt es Schriftfamilien, bei denen einzelne Schnitte frei sind, oder es gibt Fonts, bei denen ein gewisser Zeichenumfang frei ist. Damit nicht bei den einzelnen Stellen im Web nach den Fonts gesucht werden muss, empfiehlt es sich, Portale zu verwenden, die einem die verschiedenen Fonts sortiert präsentieren oder eine schnelle Suche ermöglichen. Auch bieten solche Portale zum Teil die Möglichkeit, die Fonts gleich von deren Server zu laden (google Fonts) oder gewisse Konvertierungen für den Webgebrauch (fontsquirrel) zu erledigen.\\nDie benötige Fontlizenz für eine Website sollte mit dem Kunden geklärt werden und bereits in der Offerte sollte geklärt sein, wer die Lizenz zu erwerben hat.</p>\\n<h3>Kunde oder Agentur</h3>\\n<p>Aus finanzieller Überlegung kann es attraktiv sein, die Schriftlizenzen für alle Kunden über ein Konto der Agentur zu kaufen. So können die Kosten auf die verschiedenen Webprojekte umgelegt werden. Dies hat jedoch auch den Nachteil, dass die Agentur die Verantwortung gegenüber dem Kunden hat, den Account zu bezahlen und pflegen.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h4>fonts.com</h4>\\n<p>Im nebenstehenden Beispiel sieht man, dass für $32 pro Monat eine Million Views für beliebig viele Domains erworben werden kann.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/fontcom_subscription.png\\\" alt=\\\"Abonnement für fonts.com\\\"></p>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"iconfonts\\\">Iconfonts</h2>\\n<p>Icons werden auf Websites oft verwendet um Inhalte schneller und einfacher zugänglich zu machen. Aus technischer Sicht ist es relativ einfach – für einen Programmierer – diese Icons in einen Font zu konvertieren. Zudem haben solche Icons den Vorteil, dass Sie auf vielen Betriebsystemen und Browsern funktionieren und vektorbasiert aufgebaut sind. Als Nachteil ist zu beklagen, dass für die Accessibility (Menschen mit Behinderung einen Zugang ermöglichen) es oftmals keine gute Idee ist, die Icons mit Schrift zu machen, da die Zeichen dann als Inhalt verstanden werden und zum Beispiel Screen-Reader damit Probleme haben können.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h3>Iconfonts optimieren</h3>\\n<p>Fontello.com bietet die Möglichkeit aus diversen freien Icon-Fonts sich die nötigen Icons zu suchen und dann einen eignenen Icon-Font daraus zu erstellen. Auch können eigene Icons in den Font eingebunden werden.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"imageline\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/fontello.png\\\" alt=\\\"Iconfont von fontello.com\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<div class=\\\"margin printonly\\\">\\n<h4>Autor</h4>\\n<p>Stefan Huber<br>\\nsh@signalwerk.ch</p>\\n<h4>Dokumentgeschichte</h4>\\n<p>September 2015: Erstellung<br>\\nMärz 2017: Erweiterung<br>\\nMärz 2018: Erweiterung</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"weiterfuhrende-informationen\\\">Weiterführende Informationen</h2>\\n<h3>Linksammlung</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/Jolg42/awesome-typography\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Awesome Typography</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Schriften Testsen</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://typecast.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Typecast</a> (über <a href=\\\"https://fonts.google.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Google Fonts</a> auch ohne Account)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Schriften erwerben</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.myfonts.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">MyFonts</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://typekit.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Typekit</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.fontshop.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">FontShop</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://fontstand.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Fontstand</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Freefonts</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Font Squirrel</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://fonts.google.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Google Fonts</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.dafont.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">DaFont</a> (Qualität zum Teil zweifelhaft)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Icon-Fonts erstellen</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://fontello.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Fontello</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Responsive Schriftgrössen</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Viewport Sized Typography</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#viewport-relative-lengths\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">CSS Values and Units Module Level 3</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://codeitdown.com/responsive-font-size-css/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Responsive Font Size with CSS</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Responsive Schriftanpassung</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://alistapart.com/blog/post/variable-fonts-for-responsive-design\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">A List Apart – Variable Fonts for Responsive Design</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://alistapart.com/article/live-font-interpolation-on-the-web\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">A List Apart – Live Font Interpolation on the Web</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://alistapart.com/d/412/interpolation/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">A List Apart – Live font interpolation</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.lucasfonts.com/about/interpolation-theory/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">LucasFonts – Interpolation Theory</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://font-to-width.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Font‑To‑Width Proof of Concept</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://css-tricks.com/examples/ViewportTypography/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Viewport Sized Typography</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Fonts in Webfonts konvertieren</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Font Squirrel</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Webfonts und Kompression von Webfonts</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Open_Font_Format\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Web Open Font Format -

Somit muss die Abweichung über so genannte Zeitzonen kompensiert werden:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/World_Time_Zones_Map.png\\\" alt=\\\"Zeitzonen\\\">\\nQuelle: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Time_Zones_Map.png\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\n<p>Einige Regionen und politische Einheiten sind trotz grosser Ausdehnung in den Längengraden als einheitliche Zeitzone zusammengefasst. So ist zum Beispiel ganz China in der gleichen Zeitzone (UTC+8). Dadurch ergibt sich beim Grenzüberschritt nach Afganistan der grösste «Zeitsprung» der Erde von -3.5 Stunden.</p>\\n<p>Es kann vorkommen, dass Zeitzonen «unlogisch» und schnell ändern.

Das grössere Problem war, dass teils Jahreszahlen nur zweistellig abgespeichert wurden. Also anstatt zum Beispiel 1999 wurde nur 99 abgespeichert. Beim Jahreswechsel wurde somit neu 00 abgespeichert, was anstatt 2000 als 1900 interpretiert wurde.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"numerische-notation-von-daten\\\">Numerische Notation von Daten</h2>\\n<p>Bei der numerischen Schreibweise für ein Datum gibt es diverse Standards.

Dabei handelt es sich um eine Ganzzahl (signed integer) welche die vergangenen Sekunden seit 1. Januar 1970 um 0:00 Uhr räpresentiert. Die Zahl kann ein Vorzeichen haben, also auch einen Minus-Bereich abdecken und somit Ereignisse vor 1970 repräsentieren.</p>\\n<h3>Beispiele</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>31. Dezember 1999, 23:59:59 = 946 684 799 000</li>\\n<li>22. November 1963, 18:30:00 = –192 778 200</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Jahr-2038-Problem</h3>\\n<p>Im Januar 2038 wird die Sekundenzahl so gross werden, dass die Zahl nicht mehr mit 32 Bit (vorzeichenbehaftete 32-Bit-Ganzzahl) gespeichert werden kann. Einige Computer-Systeme speichern jedoch noch immer in 32 Bit ab. Diese Systeme müssen bis spätestens dahin umgestellt werden. Neuere Systeme speichern Timestamps als 62-Bit-Wert ab. Somit kann noch für die nächsten paar Milliarden Jahre die Zahl problemlos abgespeichert werden.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<p>Quelle: <a href=\\\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahr-2038-Problem\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Year_2038_problem.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"zahlungsverkehr\\\">Zahlungsverkehr</h2>\\n<h2 id=\\\"besteuerung\\\">Besteuerung</h2>\\n<p>Viele Länder haben eine Steuer auf verkaufte Güter/Dienstleistung.

Je nach Produkt/Dienstleistung muss man einen der Sätze versteuern oder ist befreit von der Mehrwertsteuer. Bei Online-Shops gelten die selben Regeln wie an physischen Verkaufsstellen. Es ist empfehlenswert die Gesamtsumme inklusive Mehrwertsteuer anzugeben und dann je Mehrwertsteuer-Satz diese separat auszuweisen.</p>\\n<h3>Beispiel</h3>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/mwst.png\\\" alt=\\\"MwSt\\\"></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"bankverkehr\\\">Bankverkehr</h2>\\n<p>Heute wird im internationalen Bankverkehr häufig elektronisch Geld übermittelt.

Aufgaben, die zuvor manuell oder mit Lochkartenmaschinen erledigt wurden, wurden mehr und mehr mit Computern unterstützt oder abgelöst. Waren es in den Anfängen noch sehr einfache matemathische Aufgaben, so kam die Speicherung, Verarbeitung und Übermittlung von menschlicher Sprache/Kommunikation sehr Schnell dazu. 1963 kam die erste grosse Standardisierung eines Zeichensatzes zum Informationsaustausch (<a href=\\\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ASCII</a>). Durch die wachesende Verbreitung der Home-Computer (Personal Computer) in den 1980er Jahren nahm die Kommunikation über (lokale) Netzwerke oder Datenträger zu.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"geschichte-des-internets\\\">Geschichte des Internets</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Tim_Berners-Lee_2012.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Tim Berners-Lee 2012\\\"></p>\\n<h4>Tim Berners-Lee</h4>\\n<p>Gilt als der Erfinder des World Wide Webs und hat am CERN in Genf die erste Website erstellt.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Ab den frühen 1960er Jahren wurden für Grossrechner Konzepte und Techniken entworfen, die Kommunikation über eine abgeschlossene Recheneinheit hinweg ermöglichen. So wurde zuerst in militärischen Forshungsprojekten die Machbarkeit erprobt und später über akademische Forschungsförderung durch den Staat weiter unterstützt.\\nDurch die politische Situation (Kalter Krieg) angefeuert wurden Konzepte angedacht, die auch bei Störungen im Netzwerk (z. B. Nukleareangriffe) nicht zu einem Totalausfall führen und die bis anhin zentralen und fehlerintolerante Systeme wichen einer dezentrale Struktur, die sich je nach Netzzustand selber regulieren kann.<br>\\nDas ARPAnet (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) wurde vom US-Verteidigungsministerium in Auftrag gegeben und vernetzte 1969 die ersten Rechner an vier verschiedenen Universitäten in den USA. Bereits 1973 waren es 35 Hosts und im Jahr 1982 wurde auf das bis heute eingesetzte und wesentlich robusteres und flexiebleres Kommunikationsprotokoll TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) umgestellt, was gleichzeitig auch den Namen «Internet» endgültig zementierte. Als im Jahr 1992 das Internet auch für kommerzielle Unternehmen und somit auch Endkunden freigegeben wurde, ging die Anzahl von am Netzwerk angeschlossenen Computer stetig nach oben.</p>\\n<h3>Dotcom-Blase und Soziale Netzwerke</h3>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Nasdaq2.png\\\" alt=\\\"Nasdaq\\\"></p>\\n<h4>NASDAQ <br>(Technologie-Kurs USA)</h4>\\n<p>Grosse Investitionen bis 2000 gefolgt von einem «Platzen der Blase».</p>\\n<!-- Quelle: en.wikipedia.org -->\\n<p>Quelle: <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nasdaq2.png\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Nasdaq2 – Wikipedia</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Durch die stetige technische Verbesserung und dem vermehrten Zugang von Privatpersonen (Kunden)  zum Internet wurden viele Internet-Startups gegründet und ein Diversifikation der zur verfügung stehenden Inhalte und Dienstleistungen wurde stark voran getrieben. Das Internet wurde schnell auch von Investoren als Wachstumsmarkt erkannt und sowohl die Infrastruktur (Internetzugang, Computer, …) wie auch darauf aufsetztende Dienste (Mailanbieter, Online Shops) wurden stark gefördert und mit Geld unterstütz. So wurde zwischen 1995 und 2000 ein wichtiger Grundstein für das zur verfügung stehende Angebot gelegt. Als im Frühjahr 2000 sich die Investoren schlagartig aus diesen Investitionen verabschiedeten (Dotcom-Blase) platzte vorerst auch die Idee, dass auf dem neu erschlossenen (virtuellen) Marktplatz unersättliche Gewinne warten würden. Die Branche, welche in den boomenden Jahren viel aufbauen konnte rutschte in eine Kriese. Ab mitte der 2000er Jahre wurde über neue Ideen und Konzepte der Vernetzung von Informationen und Personen über Facebook, Twitter und Ähnlichen ein weiterer Anreiz geschaffen das Internet näher in den Altag ein zu bauen. Mit dem Aufkommen von mobilen Endgeräten, die über Internetzugang verfügten, wurde ab etwa 2007 (iPhone)  das Internet mehr und mehr ein stetiger Begleiter des Alltags.</p>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"struktur-des-internet\\\">Struktur des Internet</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h4>IP-Adressen</h4>\\n<p>Jeder Host (Computer im Netz) erhält eine eigene IP-Adresse. Damit wird der Computer eindeutig ansprechbar.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Das Netzwerk über das die Computer zum «Internet» verbunden sind, funktioniert auch heute grösstenteils dezentral.\\nSowohl Endkunden des Internets, wie auch Services (Server) erhalten von einem Internet service provider (ISP) eine Leitung zum globalen Netzverbund. Zudem erhält jeder Benutzer gleichzeitig eine eindeutige Adresse (IP-Address), womit das angeschlossene Gerät im Netzwerk wieder zu finden ist. Über verschiedene Zwischenstationen kann nun der eine Computer Daten an eine andere Addresse senden. Dazwischen gibt es viele Möglichkeiten zur Verbindung und es wird für jedes Datenpaket einzeln eine Rute durch dieses Netzwerk gewählt um die im Moment best mögliche Verbindung zu wählen.</p>\\n<p>Der ISP (Internet service provider) entscheidet dann je nach seinen Kapazitäten, ob er mit einem Nachbar oder anderen Server sich direkt verbinden möchte (Kabel verlegen), um somit seinen Kunden eine möglichst gute Verbindung in das andere Netz zu gewährleisten. Dadurch entstehen allmählich zwischen nahen Knoten oder zwischen hoch frequentierten Knoten mehr Verbindungen und die Kapazität des gesamten Netzwerks wächst.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize space3\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/ISP.svg\\\" alt=\\\"ISP\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"dienste\\\">Dienste</h2>\\n<p>Das «Internet» ist nur die Infrastruktur für Datenübertragung.

Sie können als Filterkriterien in der Textsuche verwendet werden, indem der Text mit dem Muster des regulären Ausdrucks abgeglichen wird. So können Regeln definiert werden, die wesentlich flexibler sind als eine sture Suche nach einer fest vorgegebenen Zeichenfolge. In menschlicher Sprache ausgedrückt könnte zum Beispiel folgendes Suchmuster (Pattern) definiert werden: Suche alle Worte, die mit dem Zeichen <code>A</code> beginnen und dem Zeichen <code>r</code> enden (RegEx: <code>\\\\bA[^ ]*r</code>).</p>\\n<h3>Geschichte</h3>\\n<p>Reguläre Ausdrücke wurden 1956 vom Mathematiker Stephen Cole Kleene erstmalig beschrieben. Diese mathematische Notation (reguläre Mengen) entstammt der theoretischen Informatik und es handelt sich dabei um eine formale Sprache – also eine abstrakte Sprache, bei der nicht die Kommunikation im Vordergrund steht, sondern die mathematische Verwendung.</p>\\n<h3>Reguläre Ausdrücke, RegEx, GREP?</h3>\\n<p>Es gibt diverse Begriffe, die stellvertretend für reguläre Ausdrücke verwendet werden. Häufig wird auch in der deutschen Sprache der englische Begriff «regular expressions» benutzt. Alternativ auch die Kurzform davon; «RegEx». Der Begriff GREP (auch: grep, Grep) steht für «global/regular expression/print» und entspringt dem Kommando <code>g/re/p</code> des Unix-Standardeditors «ed». Alle diese Begriffe lassen sich synonym verwenden und bezeichnen das selbe.</p>\\n<h3>Bedeutung &amp; Implementierungen</h3>\\n<p>Fast alle Programmiersprachen und Betriebssysteme (Konsole/Terminal) unterstützen heute reguläre Ausdrücke und seit den 1960er Jahren werden diese oft für Mustererkennungen (Suchbegriffe) in Texteditoren und zur lexikalischen Analyse in diversen Bereichen der digitalen Datenverarbeitung eingesetzt. Je nach verwendeter Implementierung (Programm) können kleine Abweichungen in der Verwendung, im Umfang oder der Notation auftauchen. JavaScript unterstützt Reguläre Ausdrücke seit <a href=\\\"https://www-archive.mozilla.org/js/language/E262-3.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ECMAScript 3</a> aus dem Jahr 1999 und seit dem weiter entwickelt.\\nReguläre ausdrücke werden auch in der Bioinformatik eingesetzt. Ein Beispiel aus Wikipedia zeigt die Beschreibung eines Proteinmotivs:\\n<code>W-x(9,11)-[VFY]-[FYW]-x(6,7)-[GSTNE]-[GSTQCR]-[FYW]-R-S-A-P</code></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"suchen\\\">Suchen</h2>\\n<h3>Zeichen und Platzhalter</h3>\\n<p>Als Zeichenliterale bezeichnen wir ein oder mehrere Buchstaben, die in einem Suchmuster enthalten sind. Der Buchstabe <code>a</code> – als Beispiel – findet nur den Buchstaben <code>a</code> und ansonsten keine weiteren Zeichen. Zusätzlich zu den expliziten Literalen gibt es noch den Punkt (<code>.</code>) als Platzhalterzeichen. Der Punkt findet jedes beliebige Zeichen. Möchte man einen Punkt suchen, so wird dieser mit einem sogenannten Escape-Zeichen (<code>.</code>) eingegeben. Neben den expliziten Zeichen gibt es noch weitere Platzhalter, welche eine spezielle Bedeutung haben. Hier einige Beispiele:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\d</code></td>\\n<td>Ziffer</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\w</code></td>\\n<td>Buchstabe &amp; Ziffer</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\s</code></td>\\n<td>Leerraumzeichen</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\b</code></td>\\n<td>Wortgrenze*</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>$</code></td>\\n<td>Ende der Linie*</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>^</code></td>\\n<td>Anfang der Linie*</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Findet eine Position in einer Zeichenkette (auch: zero-width, zero-length)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n<th>Erklärung</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>a</code></td>\\n<td>Hallo.</td>\\n<td>a</td>\\n<td>Das <code>a</code> ist ein Zeichen ohne spezieller Funktion und wird somit auch im Text gefunden</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\x{0061}</code></td>\\n<td>Hallo.</td>\\n<td>a</td>\\n<td>Zeichen können auch als Unicode-Wert angegeben werden (<code>U+0060</code> = <code>a</code>)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>.</code></td>\\n<td>Ja.</td>\\n<td>J, a, .</td>\\n<td>Der Punkt dient als Platzhalter für alle Zeichen.

Möchte man zum Beispiel nach einem <code>a</code> oder <code>b</code> suchen, so kann man dies als <code>[ab]</code> ausdrücken. Sollen ganze Mengen von Zeichen angegeben werden, so kann dies auch über eine <code>von–bis</code> Schreibweise getan werden. Also zum Beispiel findet <code>[a-d]</code> die Buchstaben <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code> und <code>d</code> (positive Zeichenklasse). Ebenso lässt sich ein Zeichenauswahl definieren, die alle Zeichen ausser die angegebenen enthält. So umschreibt der Ausdruck <code>[^A-Z]</code> zum Beispiel alle Zeichen ausser die Zeichen <code>A</code> bis <code>Z</code> (negierte Zeichenauswahl/Zeichenklasse).</p>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n<th>Erklärung</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>[a-zA-Z]</code></td>\\n<td>Hallo?</td>\\n<td>H, a, l, l, o</td>\\n<td>Findet alle Klein- und Grossbuchstaben nicht aber weitere Zeichen wie zum Beispiel das Fragezeichen.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Anwendungsbeispiel Platzhalter</h3>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Me.er</code></td>\\n<td>Meier<br/>Meyer<br/>Maier <br/>Meder</td>\\n<td>Meier<br/>Meyer<br/>×<br/>×</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Anwendungsbeispiel Zeichenklassen</h3>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>M[ae][yi]er</code></td>\\n<td>Mayer<br/>Maier<br/>Meyer<br/>Meier<br/>Meder</td>\\n<td>Mayer<br/>Maier<br/>Meyer<br/>Meier<br/>×</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>M[ae][^yi]er</code></td>\\n<td>Mayer<br/>Maier<br/>Meyer<br/>Meier<br/>Meder</td>\\n<td>×<br/>×<br/>×<br/>×<br/>Meder</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Wiederholungsfaktoren</h3>\\n<p>Wiederholungsfaktoren – auch Quantoren genannt – geben an, wie oft ein Ausdruck gefunden werden kann.

Das heisst, dass immer die grösstmögliche Entsprechung gesucht wird. So findet ein Ausdruck wie <code>a.*z</code> alle Stellen die mit <code>a</code> beginnen und mit <code>z</code> enden ungeachtet dessen, ob vor dem letzten <code>z</code> weitere <code>z</code> stehen. Dieses Verhalten kann mit einem Fragezeichen (<code>?</code>) hinter einem Quantor unterbunden werden (Bsp: <code>.*?</code>).</p>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n<th>Erklärung</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>h.*r</code></td>\\n<td>horrortheater</td>\\n<td>horrortheater</td>\\n<td>Findet im Wort die längste Entsprechung, welche nicht <code>hor</code>, nicht <code>horr</code> und auch nicht <code>horror</code> ist.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>h.*?r</code></td>\\n<td>horrortheater</td>\\n<td>hor<br/>heater</td>\\n<td>Findet nun die kürzeste Entsprechung (<code>hor</code>).

Titel, Inhaltsverzeichnis, Literaturverzeichnis und Abbildungsverzeichnis werden nicht gezählt. Es dürfen Zitate verwendet werden (Zitatrecht) der Kern der Arbeit muss jedoch eigentständig erarbeitet sein.</p>\\n<h3>Mentorat</h3>\\n<p>Die Aufgabe des Mentors ist dem Studierenden eine Rückmeldung während des Prozesses auf seine Arbeitsweise und seine Erkenntnisse zu geben.<br>\\nZum Mentorat sind alle Dozierenden berechtigt, die am Unterricht des Studiengangs beteiligt waren. Externe Mentoren können von den Studierenden vorgeschlagen werden.\\nFür das Mentorat stehen pro Person 4½ Stunden (nicht Lektionen) zur Verfügung. Es wird empfohlen dieses Zeitbudget in zwei persönlichen kurzen Sitzungen und deren Vorbereitung zu nutzen. Die Mentorierenden sind angehalten sich an die Zeitvorgaben zu halten, da sonst ein unterschiedlicher Betreuungsgrad zwischen den Studierenden entsteht.\\nBei Anfragen an externe Dozierende kann eine Entschädigung von Fr. 540.– in Aussicht gestellt werden.</p>\\n<h3>Zeitlicher Ablauf</h3>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Zeit</th>\\n<th>Task</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>23.8.2019</td>\\n<td>Thesis-Aufgabe abgeben</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>■■ noch offen ■■ 2019</td>\\n<td>2 Tage Einführung &amp; Themenfindung durch Ulrike</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>29.11.2019</td>\\n<td>Abgabe eines kurzen Exposés mit Thema, Fragestellung, Literatur und Zeitplan sowie Mentorenwunsch</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>10.1.2020</td>\\n<td>Abgabe der Thesis</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>31.1./1.2.2020</td>\\n<td>Verteidigung</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Februar</td>\\n<td>Benotung</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Bewertungskriterien</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Inhaltliche Strukturen wurden geschaffen (sprachlich, typografisch)</li>\\n<li>Angemessene Tiefe der Bearbeitung des Themas in Hinblick auf die Fragestellung</li>\\n<li>Alle Inhaltselemente wurden erarbeitet (Einleitung: Ziele, Fragestellung; Hauptteil, Fazit, Ausblick)</li>\\n<li>Der Hauptteil enthält einen Kontextteil (Theorie, Geschichte o.ä.), Anwendungsbeispiele (Konkretisierung) und eine Diskussion (Argumentation)</li>\\n<li>Text wurde mit Sorgfalt verfasst (Quellen/Sprache und Stil)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Methode · 20 %</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Text wurde mit Sorgfalt verfasst (Angemessene Tiefe der Bearbeitung des Themas in Hinblick auf die Fragestellung)</li>\\n<li>Fakten sind nachvollziebar und mit Quellen versehen</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Inhalt · 50 %</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Fragestellung relevant und zeitgemäss</li>\\n<li>Inhaltliche Detailstruktur passend zur Fragestellung</li>\\n<li>Thematische Nähe zur Ausbildung gegeben</li>\\n<li>Aussagen stimmen mit der allgemeinen Erkenntnislage überein (Richtigkeit)</li>\\n<li>Inhalt ist für den Lesenden nachvollziebar</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Erkenntnisse · 15 %</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Ableitung des Inhalts in eine Erkenntnis sichtbar</li>\\n<li>Eigenerkenntnisse werden sachlich formuliert und diskutiert</li>\\n<li>Fachliche Erkenntnis in Struktur und Sprache deutlich von persönlicher Erkenntnis getrennt</li>\\n<li>Konsistente Argumentation mit Hinterfragung bei offenen Punkten</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Aufbau, Struktur und Sprache · 15 %</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Die technischen Vorgaben sind eingehalten</li>\\n<li>Logischer und nachvollziebarer Ablauf in Argumentation und Form</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Plagiate</h3>\\n<p>Bei Plagiaten wird die ganze Arbeit mit der Note 1 bewertet.

Knapp, prägnant, mit\\nklarer Struktur und vielen Bildern untermalt. Es wird mehr eine Geschichte erzählt und eben diese Geschichte mit dem Font zusammen verkauft,\\nals der Font alleine. So könnte ich mir am ehesten eine Präsentation im Web vorstellen, natürlich mit Interaktion angereichert.

Fonts</h2>\\n<h3>Vektor zu Pixel</h3>\\n<p>Heutige Fonts bestehen meist aus Vektor-Daten, die dann für die Anzeige an einem Ausgabegerät in eine Pixel-Matrix umgesetzt werden müssen. Diese Umrechnung von Vektoren zu Pixel kann auf verschiedene Arten geschehen. Die dafür zuständige Software wird Renderer genannt und ist je nach Hersteller unterschiedlich und liefert für die selben Vektoren unterschiedliche Ergebnisse.</p>\\n<h3>Grösse in Pixel</h3>\\n<p>Die Darstellungsgrösse einer Schrift wird in PPM (pixels per em) gemessen. Also wie viele Pixel das Geviert (vertikaler Raumbedarf) einnimmt. Wird also ein Font auf eine Schriftgrösse von 20 Pixel eingestellt, so ist der vertikale Raumbedarf 20 Pixel hoch. Das effektive Schriftbild (Schwärzung) ist jedoch im allgemeinen kleiner und von Schrift zu Schrift verschieden. Siehe <a href=\\\"../font-anatomy/\\\">Fonts · Eigenschaften</a>.\\nEine Fontdatei hat intern ein ein Koordinatensystem, welches sich in Einheiten pro Geviert berechnet bei PostScript-basierten Schriften ist dies meist 1000 UPM (units per em) und bei TrueType-basierten Schriften meist 2048 UPM.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"col_6of12\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"grid w80p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/normal/Arial_a_outline.png\\\" alt=\\\"Buchstabe a als Outline\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>Font als Outline</h4>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"col_6of12_last\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"grid w80p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/normal/Arial_a_no_hint.png\\\" alt=\\\"Buchstabe a als Pixel ohne Hinting\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>12 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – S/W</h4>\\n<p>Gerendert werden alle Pixel die zu mindestens\\n50% innerhalb der Kontur liegen (ohne Hinting).</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<h3>Auflösung</h3>\\n<p>Je höher die Auflösung eines Buchstaben ist, um so klarer nähert sich die Pixel-Darstellung an die Vektorform an.\\nEine höhere Auflösung pro Buchstabe kann erreicht werden, indem die Grösse des Buchstabens oder die Auflösung des Ausgabegeräts erhöht wird.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize upscale\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_a_waterfall@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Arial as in s/w gerendert\\\"></p>\\n<h4>8 bis 48 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h4>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"darstellung-ohne-graustufen\\\">Darstellung ohne Graustufen</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"grid w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_word_waterfall_8_18px@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Textworte in Arial als s/w in 8–18px mit Microsoft Renderer\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h3>8 bis 18 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h3>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Bei kleinen Schriften oder aber bei gewissen Display-Technologien kann es sinnvoll sein, Schrift nur mit S/W darzustellen.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid upscale\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_Hamburge_8px@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Textwort in Arial als s/w in 8px mit Microsoft Renderer\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h3>8 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h3>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid upscale\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_Hamburge_24px@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Textwort in Arial als s/w in 24px mit Microsoft Renderer\\\"></p>\\n<h3>24 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h3>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Unterschiede im Rendering</h3>\\n<p>Bei der S/W-Darstellung von Schrift sind die Unterschiede zwischen verschiedenen Renderern viel weniger stark erkennbar als bei einer Darstellung mit Graustufen.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"col_4of12\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/FreeType_BW_Arial_a_13px@100x.png\\\" alt=\\\"a in Arial als s/w in 13px mit FreeType Renderer – 2014\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>FreeType-Renderer – S/W</h4>\\n<p>13 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"col_4of12\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_a_13px@100x.png\\\" alt=\\\"a in Arial als s/w in 13px mit Microsoft Renderer – 2014\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>MS-Renderer – S/W</h4>\\n<p>13 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"col_4of12_last\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Apple_BW_Arial_a_13px@100x.png\\\" alt=\\\"a in Arial als s/w in 13px mit Apple Renderer – 2014\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>Apple-Renderer – S/W</h4>\\n<p>13 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"hinting\\\">Hinting</h2>\\n<p>Über spezielle Instruktionen wird die Kontur einer Schrift so verformt, dass die Darstellung besser auf ein Pixel-Grid passt.

Zu Wörtern und Sätzen zusammengestellt vermitteln sie eine Aussage, die nicht nur inhaltlich, sondern auch optisch beinfluss- und manipulierbar sind. Die Buchstaben sind die Einzelteile des Alphabets und repräsentieren einen einzelnen Laut (Phonem) der menschlichen Sprache. Die Versalformen (Grossbuchstaben) basieren auf der Römischen Kapitalis (in Stein geschlagene Schrift), das gemeine Alphabet (Kleinbuchstaben) auf der Weiterentwicklung dieser Formen (karolingische Minuskel, humanistische Minuskel). Der Buchstabe als visuelles Zeichen der Sprache hat vorwiegend bei der Darstellung oder Übermittlung von Botschaften eine Bedeutung. Nur in seltenen Fällen, wird auch im gesprochenen Kontext auf Buchstaben zurückgegriffen (Buchstabieren).</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"romische-capitalis-monumentalis\\\">Römische Capitalis Monumentalis</h2>\\n<p>Die Capitalis Monumentalis ist eine der wichtigsten römischen Schriften aus der Antike. Sie wird auch als Lapidarschrift bezeichnet, da sie vorwiegend mit Pinsel auf Stein (lateinisch lapis = Stein) geschrieben wurde und dann die form aus dem Stein gemeisselt. Sie gilt massgebend für die Formgebung der heutigen Grossbuchstaben. Die Capitalis Monumentalis besteht nur aus Grossbuchstaben (Versalschrift) und beinhaltet noch nicht alle heutezutage gebräuchlichen Schriftzeichen.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/capitalis/capitalis_monumentalis.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\">\\nRömisches Nationalmuseum in den Thermen des Diolektian, Rom</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"karolingische-minuskel\\\">Karolingische Minuskel</h2>\\n<p>Die karolingische Minuskel wurde zum Ende des 8. Jahrhunderts im Auftrag von Karl dem Grossen als einheitliche Buch- und Schreibschrift entwickelt.

Bücher wurden somit von Hand in Skriptorien in Klöstern (Schreibstuben) abgeschrieben. Eine Kopie mit meist aufwendigen Ausschmückungen konnte mehrere Jahre Arbeit in Anspruch nehmen. Erst ab ende des Mittelalters gab es auch mehr und mehr kommerzielle Berufsschreiber ausserhalb von Kölstern.</p>\\n<p>Ab dem 14.

Als Goldschmied konnte Gutenberg mit Metall umgehen und erfand ein Handgiessinstrument das es ihm ermöglicht hat, dieselben Buchstaben aus einer Legierung (mit dem Hauptanteil Blei) immer wieder zu giessen. Die so gegossenen Zeichen waren wie kleine erhabene Stempel. Dazu musste die Druckfarbe, die nun auf Bleibuchstaben haften musste, als auch eine abgeänderte Spindelpresse erfunden oder weiterentwickelt werden, um die ersten Druckprodukte mit dieser neuartigen Technik zu produzieren.\\nDiese Erfindung des Buchdruck (Hochdruckverfahren) verbreitete sich ab ~1450 ausgehend von Mainz (Deutschland) innert weniger Jahre über die ganze Welt und wurde technisch beinahe unverändert bis ins 20. Jahrhundert beibehalten.\\n~1455 erschien Gutenbergs 42-zeilige Biebel (B42), welches als erstes gedrucktes Buch mit beweglichen Bleilettern gillt. Gutenberg hatte dafür die damals übliche Textura (Schriftart) der Schreibstuben in Bleibuchstaben überführt und mit vielen verschiedenen Ligaturen und Zeichenformen das «künschtliche Schreiben» möglichst ähnlich dem damals vorherschenden Schreibstiel angepasst.</p>\\n<p>Der Wachsende Bedarf an Bedruckstoffen fürhte dazu, dass prozentual immer weniger Bücher auf Pergament gedruckt wurden. Jedoch galten bis ins 19. Jahrhundert Pergament-Bände als besonders Wertvoll.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"col_6of12\\\">\\n<h4>Johannes Gutenberg</h4>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/typesetting/gutenberg.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Johann Gensfleisch zum Gutenberg, Kupferstich nach André Thevet, 1584.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"col_6of12_last\\\">\\n<h4>Bleiletter</h4>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/typesetting/Bleiletter.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Schriftherstellung</h3>\\n<p>Für die Herstellung von Bleilettern benötigt man eine Matrize, von der man giessen kann.

Als das World Wide Web 1993 durch das CERN frei gegeben wird, war die Formatierung noch nicht durch einen Gestalter zu beeinflussen. Lediglich der Browser bestimmte das aussehen. Mit der Einführung von CSS im Jahre 1996 wurde dann die Möglichkeit geschaffen, Schriften einem Inhalt zu zuweisen. Allerdings musste der entsprechende Font bereits auf dem Zielgerät installiert sein. Bereits 1997 ermöglichte Microsoft mit damaliger Technologie in Ihrem Browser das Laden von Fonts über das Internet. Somit wurde es möglich, eigene Schriften einzusetzen. Doch diese Technologie war nur auf Internet Explorer (Windows) verfügbar und auch von den Font-Anbietern sehr schlecht akzeptiert. Erst im Jahre 2009 wurde auf Grundlage von OpenType ein neues Format namens «WOFF» (Web Open Font Format) entwickelt. Dieses Format wurde sehr schnell von Browser-Herstellern und von Font-Anbietern akzeptiert, so dass heute Problemlos auf allen wichtigen Browsern der vom Gestalter gewünschte Font dynamisch in die Seite geladen werden kann.</p>\\n<h3>Web Safe Fonts (Systemfonts)</h3>\\n<p>Unter Systemfonts wird häufig eine Auswahl an Schriften verstanden, die zu einer sehr hohen Wahrscheinlichkeit auf dem Betriebssystem installiert sind, auf dem ein Browser eine Website darstellt. Somit ist der Browser in der Lage diesen Font zu verwenden und es muss kein zusätzlicher Font übertragen werden. Die Auswahl dieser Fonts ist sehr beschränkt und variiert stark von Betriebssystem zu Betriebssystem. Um dennoch die Gestaltung mehr oder weniger unter Kontrolle zu behalten, werden in einem CSS sogenannte Fallbacks angegeben. Das heisst, wenn eine Schrift nicht vorhanden ist, so kommt eine andere zum Einsatz.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel</h4>\\n<p>CSS-Definition mit Font-Fallbacks:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\np {\\n  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<p>Es wird versucht zuerst Arial einzusetzen. Wenn keine Arial vorhanden ist, soll Helvetica zum Einsatz kommen und sonst eine beliebige Serifenlose.</p>\\n<h3>Verbreitung und Vorteile von Webfonts</h3>\\n<p>Meist kommt bei Webfonts das WOFF (Web Open Font Format) zum Einsatz. Seit 2014 sind auch die besser komprimierten WOFF 2.0 Dateien im Gebrauch, die heute von allen modernen Browsern unterstützt werden. Auch ältere Browser können mit älteren Font-Formaten (EOT)  Schriften einbinden.\\nVerfügt man über eine Lizenz eines Webfonts, so kann diese Schrift dynamisch zur Seite hinzugeladen werden. Der Gestalter weiss somit, wie seine Seite aussehen wird und kann die Typografie vollständig kontrollieren.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Fallback</h4>\\n<p>Damit der Webfont von möglichst vielen Browsern gelesen werden kann, werden diverse Fallbacks definiert.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>CSS-Definition für Webfonts:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\n@font-face {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans';\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot'); /* IE9 */\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), /* IE6 - IE8 */\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff2') format('woff2'), /* Modern Browsers */\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff') format('woff'), /* OK Browsers */\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.ttf') format('truetype'); /* Safari, Android, iOS */\\n  font-weight: normal; <!–– ** ––>\\n  font-style: normal;\\n}\\n\\np {\\n  font-family: \\\"Open Sans\\\", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h4>Beispiel google-Fonts</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans');\\n\\np {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Unicode Range</h3>\\n<p>Möchte man nur eine speziefische Auswahl an Buchstaben (Subset) eines Fonts von einer anderen Font-Datei beziehen, so kann dies mittels <code>unicode-range</code> gemacht werden. Dies ist vor allem nützlich, wenn wichtige Zeichen in einem Font fehlen (beispielsweise geschütztes schmales Leerzeichen) und von einer anderen Datei bezogen werden müssen.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel</h4>\\n<p>CSS-Definition mit <code>unicode-range</code> aus zwei font-faces:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\n@font-face {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans';\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot');\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff2') format('woff2'),\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff') format('woff'),\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.ttf') format('truetype');\\n  font-weight: normal;\\n  font-style: normal;\\n  unicode-range: U+000-5FF; /* Latin glyphs */  <!–– ** ––>\\n}\\n\\n@font-face {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans';\\n  src: url('special-web.eot');\\n  src: url('special-web.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),\\n  url('special-web.woff2') format('woff2'),\\n  url('special-web.woff') format('woff'),\\n  url('special-web.ttf') format('truetype');\\n  font-weight: normal;\\n  font-style: normal;\\n  unicode-range: U+0061; /* overwrite for letter a */  <!–– ** ––>\\n}\\n\\np {\\n  font-family: \\\"Open Sans\\\", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h3>OpenType features</h3>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Links</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://helpx.adobe.com/typekit/using/open-type-syntax.html#ordn\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Übersicht über die OpenType-Features von Adobe</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/font-feature-settings/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Anwendung – css-tricks</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">MDN</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://blog.bramp.net/post/2018/01/21/google-font-features/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Google vs. Font Features</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n<p>Auch im Web sind OpenType features wie Ligaturen oder verschiedenen Zahlensets möglich.

Adobe, Google, Microsoft und Andere haben zugesagt diesen Standard bald in Ihre Software-Produkte zu integireren. Neben diversen eher technischen Erneuerungen ist vor allem die Möglichkeit für «Variable Fonts» für Gestalter heraus zu streichen. Mit dieser Funktion können Fonts mehrere so genannte Design-Achsen haben. Man kann also Fonts so einrichten, dass Sie zum Beispiel von ganz Light zu super Black stuffenlos (oder mit vom Designer gewählten Stufen) einstellbar sind. Aber auch andere Design-Achsen lassen sich frei vom Schriftdesinger bestimmen. Diese Technologie erinnert an die «Multiple master fonts» (1991), jedoch wird sich der neue Standard wohl besser verbreiten als die damalige Technologie.</p>\\n<h3>CSS und Web</h3>\\n<p>Im Moment werden Variable Fonts gerade in die Software-Produkte eingebaut. Erste Test-Versionen sind für Entwickler zugägnlich. Folgende CSS-Attribute sind vom Standard vorgesehen:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>font-weight</code> – Schriftstärke als Zahl von 1–999</li>\\n<li><code>font-stretch</code> – Schriftbreite in % (50% = Condesed, 200% Extended)</li>\\n<li><code>font-style</code> – Schriftlage zwischen -90° und +90°</li>\\n<li><code>font-optical-sizing</code> – Optische Schriftgrösen ein- oder ausschalten</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br>\\n<p>Daneben lassen sich aber auch weitere Werte-Achsen wie folgt definieren;</p>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<p>Hier wird jeweils eine Werte-Achse mit vier Buchstaben (vom Designer bestimmt) mit einem Wert angewandt.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\np {\\n    font-variation-settings: \\\"wdth\\\" 600, \\\"wght\\\" 200, \\\"opsz\\\" 48;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"fonts-finden-testen\\\">Fonts finden &amp; testen</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Mieten von Desktop-Fonts</h4>\\n<p>Auf fontstand.com können Desktop-Fonts gemietet werden. Dies ermöglicht Entwürfe dem Kunden vor zu legen, ohne den Font gekauft zu haben.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Fonts für Web- und Screendesign können von fast allen grossen und kleinen Font-Foundrys erworben werden. Es gibt vereinzelt Schriften, die (noch) nicht für den Web-Einsatz lizenziert werden können, dies ist jedoch eher die Ausnahme. Für Anwendungen ausserhalb des Webs – aber auf Screens – gibt es eher wenige Anbieter. So bietet zum Beispiel Linotype auch für eBooks, Apps und Server-Anwendungen Lizenzen. Diese Lizenztypen sind jedoch bei anderen Firmen oft nur mit Verhandlungen zu erwerben und es gibt keine standardisierten Prozesse.\\nDas Vorgehen zur Recherche von neuen Schriften unterscheidet sich nicht wesentlich vom finden von Schriften für den Print-Bereich. Sucht man eine Schrift, deren Name schon bekannt ist, so kann direkt zum Anbieter gesprungen werden. Ist man eher auf der Suche nach einem bestimmten Stil, kann eine Font-Plattform wie myfonts.com genutzt werden um ein entsprechendes Design zu finden.</p>\\n<h3>Testen</h3>\\n<p>Beim Suchen von Schriften ist es ratsam, die Schrift möglichst in einem Live-Preview auf die Tauglichkeit am Bildschirm zu prüfen. Deshalb können Fonts bei immer mehr Anbietern entweder auf der Seite getestet werden, oder aber Sie kooperieren mit Test-Platformen wie zum Beispiel typecast.com. Bei solch einem Dienst kann bereits vor dem Kauf geprüft werden, ob die Schrift bei gewünschter Anwendung, Grösse und Schriftmischung auf dem Screen funktioniert.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h3>Vor dem Kauf testen</h3>\\n<p>Auf typecast.com können Text-Layouts bereits vor dem Kauf einer Schrift definiert und editiert werden.\\nDies erleichtert die Wahl eines geeigneten Fonts und zudem kann dem Kunden bereits ein Eindruck der fertigen Site vermittelt werden.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"imageline\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/typecast.png\\\" alt=\\\"Fonts mit typecast.com testen\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"fontlizenzen\\\">Fontlizenzen</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Mieten (pro Monat)</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.fonts.com/unlimited#pricing\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">fonts.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://typekit.com/plans\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Typekit</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Fonts einmalig kaufen</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.urwpp.de/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">→ URW++</a> (zeitlich beschränkt)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.fontshop.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">→ Fontshop</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Views kaufen</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.linotype.com/de/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">→ linotype.com</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n<p>Es gibt grundsätzlich drei verschiedene Arten von kommerziellen Font-Lizenzen:</p>\\n<h3>Miet-Lizenzen</h3>\\n<p>Beim mieten von Lizenzen wird meist ein View-Volumen pro Monat gekauft unabhängig jedoch von der Anzahl der Fonts. So kann zum Beispiel bei fonts.com ein Account erworben werden, der 50 000 Pageviews pro Monat auf einer Domain erlaubt. Wird diese Zahl überschritten, muss auf ein höherer Preisplan gewechselt werden. Oft kann ein Account für diverse Projekte gleichzeitig verwendet werden. Die Fonts sind beim Anbieter gehostet.</p>\\n<h3>Einmalige Lizenzkosten</h3>\\n<p>Bei immer wenigen Anbietern kann eine Lizenz einmalig erworben werden. Bei einer solchen Lizenz wird diee Schrift meist auf dem eigenen Server installiert und der Schriftenanbieter vertraut darauf, dass der Käufer die Anzahl Views pro Monat, für die Lizenziert wurde, nicht überschritten wird.</p>\\n<h3>Kaufen von Views</h3>\\n<p>Es gibt Anbieter, die Views verkaufen. Das heisst, dass mit jedem Besuch einer Webseite mit dem Font das erworbene «Konto» um ein View reduziert wird. Somit muss die Schrift von Zeit zu Zeit wieder mit neuen Views aktiviert werden, so dass immer genügend Views vorhanden sind. Oder aber das Konto erneuert sich immer am Ende des Monats neu.</p>\\n<h3>Zeichensatz</h3>\\n<p>Wird die Schrift auf einer Seite eingesetzt, bei der viele Sprachen oder sonst spezielle Zeichen vorkommen, so ist es empfehlenswert zu Prüfen, ob die Schrift auch den nötigen Zeichensatz abdeckt. Auch OpenType-Features werden von den Schriftherstellern normalerweise vor dem Kauf angegeben.</p>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"freefonts-kommerzielle-fonts\\\">Freefonts – Kommerzielle Fonts</h2>\\n<p>Es gibt von diversen Font Foundries, Firmen und Enthusiasten qualitativ sehr hochwertige und gute Schriften, die frei verfügbar sind. Dabei gibt es diverse Abstufungen. Es gibt ganze Schriftfamilien, die frei sind, dann gibt es Schriftfamilien, bei denen einzelne Schnitte frei sind, oder es gibt Fonts, bei denen ein gewisser Zeichenumfang frei ist. Damit nicht bei den einzelnen Stellen im Web nach den Fonts gesucht werden muss, empfiehlt es sich, Portale zu verwenden, die einem die verschiedenen Fonts sortiert präsentieren oder eine schnelle Suche ermöglichen. Auch bieten solche Portale zum Teil die Möglichkeit, die Fonts gleich von deren Server zu laden (google Fonts) oder gewisse Konvertierungen für den Webgebrauch (fontsquirrel) zu erledigen.\\nDie benötige Fontlizenz für eine Website sollte mit dem Kunden geklärt werden und bereits in der Offerte sollte geklärt sein, wer die Lizenz zu erwerben hat.</p>\\n<h3>Kunde oder Agentur</h3>\\n<p>Aus finanzieller Überlegung kann es attraktiv sein, die Schriftlizenzen für alle Kunden über ein Konto der Agentur zu kaufen. So können die Kosten auf die verschiedenen Webprojekte umgelegt werden. Dies hat jedoch auch den Nachteil, dass die Agentur die Verantwortung gegenüber dem Kunden hat, den Account zu bezahlen und pflegen.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h4>fonts.com</h4>\\n<p>Im nebenstehenden Beispiel sieht man, dass für $32 pro Monat eine Million Views für beliebig viele Domains erworben werden kann.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/fontcom_subscription.png\\\" alt=\\\"Abonnement für fonts.com\\\"></p>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"iconfonts\\\">Iconfonts</h2>\\n<p>Icons werden auf Websites oft verwendet um Inhalte schneller und einfacher zugänglich zu machen. Aus technischer Sicht ist es relativ einfach – für einen Programmierer – diese Icons in einen Font zu konvertieren. Zudem haben solche Icons den Vorteil, dass Sie auf vielen Betriebsystemen und Browsern funktionieren und vektorbasiert aufgebaut sind. Als Nachteil ist zu beklagen, dass für die Accessibility (Menschen mit Behinderung einen Zugang ermöglichen) es oftmals keine gute Idee ist, die Icons mit Schrift zu machen, da die Zeichen dann als Inhalt verstanden werden und zum Beispiel Screen-Reader damit Probleme haben können.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h3>Iconfonts optimieren</h3>\\n<p>Fontello.com bietet die Möglichkeit aus diversen freien Icon-Fonts sich die nötigen Icons zu suchen und dann einen eignenen Icon-Font daraus zu erstellen. Auch können eigene Icons in den Font eingebunden werden.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"imageline\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/fontello.png\\\" alt=\\\"Iconfont von fontello.com\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<div class=\\\"margin printonly\\\">\\n<h4>Autor</h4>\\n<p>Stefan Huber<br>\\nsh@signalwerk.ch</p>\\n<h4>Dokumentgeschichte</h4>\\n<p>September 2015: Erstellung<br>\\nMärz 2017: Erweiterung<br>\\nMärz 2018: Erweiterung</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"weiterfuhrende-informationen\\\">Weiterführende Informationen</h2>\\n<h3>Linksammlung</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/Jolg42/awesome-typography\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Awesome Typography</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Schriften Testsen</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://typecast.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Typecast</a> (über <a href=\\\"https://fonts.google.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Google Fonts</a> auch ohne Account)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Schriften erwerben</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.myfonts.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">MyFonts</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://typekit.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Typekit</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.fontshop.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">FontShop</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://fontstand.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Fontstand</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Freefonts</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Font Squirrel</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://fonts.google.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Google Fonts</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.dafont.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">DaFont</a> (Qualität zum Teil zweifelhaft)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Icon-Fonts erstellen</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://fontello.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Fontello</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Responsive Schriftgrössen</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Viewport Sized Typography</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#viewport-relative-lengths\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">CSS Values and Units Module Level 3</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://codeitdown.com/responsive-font-size-css/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Responsive Font Size with CSS</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Responsive Schriftanpassung</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://alistapart.com/blog/post/variable-fonts-for-responsive-design\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">A List Apart – Variable Fonts for Responsive Design</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://alistapart.com/article/live-font-interpolation-on-the-web\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">A List Apart – Live Font Interpolation on the Web</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://alistapart.com/d/412/interpolation/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">A List Apart – Live font interpolation</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.lucasfonts.com/about/interpolation-theory/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">LucasFonts – Interpolation Theory</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://font-to-width.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Font‑To‑Width Proof of Concept</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://css-tricks.com/examples/ViewportTypography/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Viewport Sized Typography</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Fonts in Webfonts konvertieren</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Font Squirrel</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Webfonts und Kompression von Webfonts</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Open_Font_Format\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Web Open Font Format -

Die Zeitmessung wird jedoch meist daran gerichtet, dass man um Mittag den höchsten Sonnenstand möchte. Somit muss die Abweichung über so genannte Zeitzonen kompensiert werden:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/World_Time_Zones_Map.png\\\" alt=\\\"Zeitzonen\\\">\\nQuelle: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Time_Zones_Map.png\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\n<p>Einige Regionen und politische Einheiten sind trotz grosser Ausdehnung in den Längengraden als einheitliche Zeitzone zusammengefasst. So ist zum Beispiel ganz China in der gleichen Zeitzone (UTC+8). Dadurch ergibt sich beim Grenzüberschritt nach Afganistan der grösste «Zeitsprung» der Erde von -3.5 Stunden.</p>\\n<p>Es kann vorkommen, dass Zeitzonen «unlogisch» und schnell ändern. Beispiel hierfür ist Australien, welches im Jahr 2000 für die dauer der Olymischen Sommerspiele und im Jahr 2006 für die «Commonwealth Games» ihre Zeitzonen vereinheitlichte.</p>\\n<h3>UTC – Coordinated Universal Time</h3>\\n<p>Seit 1884 wird der <a href=\\\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullmeridian\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Nullmeridian</a> basierend auf der Ortschaft Greenwich (England) verwendet um die Zeitmessung international standardisiert zu koordinieren.

Danach steht es den Mitgliedstaaten frei ob sie in Normal- oder Sommerzeit ihre weiter fahren. Es bleibt zu hoffen, dass die Staaten sich einigen können, so dass es weiterhin eine grosse geschlossene Zeitzone (MEZ) in der EU gibt.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"datum-kalender\\\">Datum &amp; Kalender</h2>\\n<p>Der <a href=\\\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorianischer_Kalender\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">gregorianische Kalender</a> ist weltweit der meist gebrauchte Kalender und wurde im Jahr 1582 von Papst Gregor XIII verordnet. Dabei hat das Jahr (Umlauf der Erde um die Sonne) im Durchschnitt etwa 365,25 Tage und diese werden auf 12 Monate verteilt. Die Schaltjahre haben 366 Tage, sonstige Jahre werden mit 365 Tagen geführt.</p>\\n<h3>Regeln für Schaltjahre</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>1. Regel: Jahreszahl durch vier ganzzahlig teilbaren = Schaltjahr</li>\\n<li>2. Regel: Jahreszahl durch 100 ganzzahlig teilbaren = kein Schaltjahr (1. Regel überlegen)</li>\\n<li>3. Regel: Jahreszahl durch 400 ganzzahlig teilbaren = Schaltjahr (2. Regel überlegen)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Jahr-2000-Problem</h3>\\n<p>Im Jahr 2000 gab es zwei Probleme; Das kleinere Problem war, dass diverse Software das Schaltjahr im Jahr 2000 nicht korrekt berechnet hatten und fälschlich keine Schaltjahr annahmen. Das grössere Problem war, dass teils Jahreszahlen nur zweistellig abgespeichert wurden. Also anstatt zum Beispiel 1999 wurde nur 99 abgespeichert. Beim Jahreswechsel wurde somit neu 00 abgespeichert, was anstatt 2000 als 1900 interpretiert wurde.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"numerische-notation-von-daten\\\">Numerische Notation von Daten</h2>\\n<p>Bei der numerischen Schreibweise für ein Datum gibt es diverse Standards.

Aufgaben, die zuvor manuell oder mit Lochkartenmaschinen erledigt wurden, wurden mehr und mehr mit Computern unterstützt oder abgelöst. Waren es in den Anfängen noch sehr einfache matemathische Aufgaben, so kam die Speicherung, Verarbeitung und Übermittlung von menschlicher Sprache/Kommunikation sehr Schnell dazu. 1963 kam die erste grosse Standardisierung eines Zeichensatzes zum Informationsaustausch (<a href=\\\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ASCII</a>). Durch die wachesende Verbreitung der Home-Computer (Personal Computer) in den 1980er Jahren nahm die Kommunikation über (lokale) Netzwerke oder Datenträger zu.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"geschichte-des-internets\\\">Geschichte des Internets</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Tim_Berners-Lee_2012.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Tim Berners-Lee 2012\\\"></p>\\n<h4>Tim Berners-Lee</h4>\\n<p>Gilt als der Erfinder des World Wide Webs und hat am CERN in Genf die erste Website erstellt.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Ab den frühen 1960er Jahren wurden für Grossrechner Konzepte und Techniken entworfen, die Kommunikation über eine abgeschlossene Recheneinheit hinweg ermöglichen. So wurde zuerst in militärischen Forshungsprojekten die Machbarkeit erprobt und später über akademische Forschungsförderung durch den Staat weiter unterstützt.\\nDurch die politische Situation (Kalter Krieg) angefeuert wurden Konzepte angedacht, die auch bei Störungen im Netzwerk (z. B. Nukleareangriffe) nicht zu einem Totalausfall führen und die bis anhin zentralen und fehlerintolerante Systeme wichen einer dezentrale Struktur, die sich je nach Netzzustand selber regulieren kann.<br>\\nDas ARPAnet (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) wurde vom US-Verteidigungsministerium in Auftrag gegeben und vernetzte 1969 die ersten Rechner an vier verschiedenen Universitäten in den USA. Bereits 1973 waren es 35 Hosts und im Jahr 1982 wurde auf das bis heute eingesetzte und wesentlich robusteres und flexiebleres Kommunikationsprotokoll TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) umgestellt, was gleichzeitig auch den Namen «Internet» endgültig zementierte. Als im Jahr 1992 das Internet auch für kommerzielle Unternehmen und somit auch Endkunden freigegeben wurde, ging die Anzahl von am Netzwerk angeschlossenen Computer stetig nach oben.</p>\\n<h3>Dotcom-Blase und Soziale Netzwerke</h3>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Nasdaq2.png\\\" alt=\\\"Nasdaq\\\"></p>\\n<h4>NASDAQ <br>(Technologie-Kurs USA)</h4>\\n<p>Grosse Investitionen bis 2000 gefolgt von einem «Platzen der Blase».</p>\\n<!-- Quelle: en.wikipedia.org -->\\n<p>Quelle: <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nasdaq2.png\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Nasdaq2 – Wikipedia</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Durch die stetige technische Verbesserung und dem vermehrten Zugang von Privatpersonen (Kunden)  zum Internet wurden viele Internet-Startups gegründet und ein Diversifikation der zur verfügung stehenden Inhalte und Dienstleistungen wurde stark voran getrieben. Das Internet wurde schnell auch von Investoren als Wachstumsmarkt erkannt und sowohl die Infrastruktur (Internetzugang, Computer, …) wie auch darauf aufsetztende Dienste (Mailanbieter, Online Shops) wurden stark gefördert und mit Geld unterstütz. So wurde zwischen 1995 und 2000 ein wichtiger Grundstein für das zur verfügung stehende Angebot gelegt. Als im Frühjahr 2000 sich die Investoren schlagartig aus diesen Investitionen verabschiedeten (Dotcom-Blase) platzte vorerst auch die Idee, dass auf dem neu erschlossenen (virtuellen) Marktplatz unersättliche Gewinne warten würden. Die Branche, welche in den boomenden Jahren viel aufbauen konnte rutschte in eine Kriese. Ab mitte der 2000er Jahre wurde über neue Ideen und Konzepte der Vernetzung von Informationen und Personen über Facebook, Twitter und Ähnlichen ein weiterer Anreiz geschaffen das Internet näher in den Altag ein zu bauen. Mit dem Aufkommen von mobilen Endgeräten, die über Internetzugang verfügten, wurde ab etwa 2007 (iPhone)  das Internet mehr und mehr ein stetiger Begleiter des Alltags.</p>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"struktur-des-internet\\\">Struktur des Internet</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h4>IP-Adressen</h4>\\n<p>Jeder Host (Computer im Netz) erhält eine eigene IP-Adresse. Damit wird der Computer eindeutig ansprechbar.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Das Netzwerk über das die Computer zum «Internet» verbunden sind, funktioniert auch heute grösstenteils dezentral.\\nSowohl Endkunden des Internets, wie auch Services (Server) erhalten von einem Internet service provider (ISP) eine Leitung zum globalen Netzverbund. Zudem erhält jeder Benutzer gleichzeitig eine eindeutige Adresse (IP-Address), womit das angeschlossene Gerät im Netzwerk wieder zu finden ist. Über verschiedene Zwischenstationen kann nun der eine Computer Daten an eine andere Addresse senden. Dazwischen gibt es viele Möglichkeiten zur Verbindung und es wird für jedes Datenpaket einzeln eine Rute durch dieses Netzwerk gewählt um die im Moment best mögliche Verbindung zu wählen.</p>\\n<p>Der ISP (Internet service provider) entscheidet dann je nach seinen Kapazitäten, ob er mit einem Nachbar oder anderen Server sich direkt verbinden möchte (Kabel verlegen), um somit seinen Kunden eine möglichst gute Verbindung in das andere Netz zu gewährleisten. Dadurch entstehen allmählich zwischen nahen Knoten oder zwischen hoch frequentierten Knoten mehr Verbindungen und die Kapazität des gesamten Netzwerks wächst.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize space3\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/ISP.svg\\\" alt=\\\"ISP\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"dienste\\\">Dienste</h2>\\n<p>Das «Internet» ist nur die Infrastruktur für Datenübertragung.

Um diese Dienstleistung zu erhalten muss die Gegenstelle über einen entsprechenden Client Verfügen.</p>\\n<h3>Dienstenutzer (Client)</h3>\\n<p>Um einen Dienst eines Servers zu nutzen, muss der Client das verwendete Protokoll verstehen können und sich mit dem Server über die Kommunikation einig sein. Kommt diese Übereinkunft zustande, so kann der Nutzer den Server als Dienstleister via Client benutzen.</p>\\n<h3>URL</h3>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h4>Bestandteile einer URL</h4>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Teil</th>\\n<th>Bedeutung</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>http://</td>\\n<td>Angabe über das Protokoll</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>www</td>\\n<td>Subdomain</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>switch</td>\\n<td>Domain</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>ch</td>\\n<td>Top-Level Domain</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>index</td>\\n<td>Dateiname</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>html</td>\\n<td>Dateiendung</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h4>Anzeigen einer Website</h4>\\n<p>Ein Benutzer möchte die Website <a href=\\\"http://www.switch.ch/index.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">switch.ch</a> betrachten.

Je nach Registrar können verschiedene Top-Level-Domains mit unterschiedlichen Endungen gebucht werden.\\nMöchte man die Domain gezielt an einen neuen Halter überführen, so kann dies meist mit einem Transfer-Code ausgelöst werden. Je nach Registrar kann dies technisch unterschiedlich funktionieren.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"registrare-in-der-schweiz\\\">Registrare in der Schweiz</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h4>Switch ist nicht mehr zuständig</h4>\\n<p>Seit dem 1.

Sie können als Filterkriterien in der Textsuche verwendet werden, indem der Text mit dem Muster des regulären Ausdrucks abgeglichen wird. So können Regeln definiert werden, die wesentlich flexibler sind als eine sture Suche nach einer fest vorgegebenen Zeichenfolge. In menschlicher Sprache ausgedrückt könnte zum Beispiel folgendes Suchmuster (Pattern) definiert werden: Suche alle Worte, die mit dem Zeichen <code>A</code> beginnen und dem Zeichen <code>r</code> enden (RegEx: <code>\\\\bA[^ ]*r</code>).</p>\\n<h3>Geschichte</h3>\\n<p>Reguläre Ausdrücke wurden 1956 vom Mathematiker Stephen Cole Kleene erstmalig beschrieben. Diese mathematische Notation (reguläre Mengen) entstammt der theoretischen Informatik und es handelt sich dabei um eine formale Sprache – also eine abstrakte Sprache, bei der nicht die Kommunikation im Vordergrund steht, sondern die mathematische Verwendung.</p>\\n<h3>Reguläre Ausdrücke, RegEx, GREP?</h3>\\n<p>Es gibt diverse Begriffe, die stellvertretend für reguläre Ausdrücke verwendet werden. Häufig wird auch in der deutschen Sprache der englische Begriff «regular expressions» benutzt. Alternativ auch die Kurzform davon; «RegEx». Der Begriff GREP (auch: grep, Grep) steht für «global/regular expression/print» und entspringt dem Kommando <code>g/re/p</code> des Unix-Standardeditors «ed». Alle diese Begriffe lassen sich synonym verwenden und bezeichnen das selbe.</p>\\n<h3>Bedeutung &amp; Implementierungen</h3>\\n<p>Fast alle Programmiersprachen und Betriebssysteme (Konsole/Terminal) unterstützen heute reguläre Ausdrücke und seit den 1960er Jahren werden diese oft für Mustererkennungen (Suchbegriffe) in Texteditoren und zur lexikalischen Analyse in diversen Bereichen der digitalen Datenverarbeitung eingesetzt. Je nach verwendeter Implementierung (Programm) können kleine Abweichungen in der Verwendung, im Umfang oder der Notation auftauchen. JavaScript unterstützt Reguläre Ausdrücke seit <a href=\\\"https://www-archive.mozilla.org/js/language/E262-3.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ECMAScript 3</a> aus dem Jahr 1999 und seit dem weiter entwickelt.\\nReguläre ausdrücke werden auch in der Bioinformatik eingesetzt. Ein Beispiel aus Wikipedia zeigt die Beschreibung eines Proteinmotivs:\\n<code>W-x(9,11)-[VFY]-[FYW]-x(6,7)-[GSTNE]-[GSTQCR]-[FYW]-R-S-A-P</code></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"suchen\\\">Suchen</h2>\\n<h3>Zeichen und Platzhalter</h3>\\n<p>Als Zeichenliterale bezeichnen wir ein oder mehrere Buchstaben, die in einem Suchmuster enthalten sind. Der Buchstabe <code>a</code> – als Beispiel – findet nur den Buchstaben <code>a</code> und ansonsten keine weiteren Zeichen. Zusätzlich zu den expliziten Literalen gibt es noch den Punkt (<code>.</code>) als Platzhalterzeichen. Der Punkt findet jedes beliebige Zeichen. Möchte man einen Punkt suchen, so wird dieser mit einem sogenannten Escape-Zeichen (<code>.</code>) eingegeben. Neben den expliziten Zeichen gibt es noch weitere Platzhalter, welche eine spezielle Bedeutung haben. Hier einige Beispiele:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\d</code></td>\\n<td>Ziffer</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\w</code></td>\\n<td>Buchstabe &amp; Ziffer</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\s</code></td>\\n<td>Leerraumzeichen</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\b</code></td>\\n<td>Wortgrenze*</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>$</code></td>\\n<td>Ende der Linie*</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>^</code></td>\\n<td>Anfang der Linie*</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Findet eine Position in einer Zeichenkette (auch: zero-width, zero-length)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n<th>Erklärung</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>a</code></td>\\n<td>Hallo.</td>\\n<td>a</td>\\n<td>Das <code>a</code> ist ein Zeichen ohne spezieller Funktion und wird somit auch im Text gefunden</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\x{0061}</code></td>\\n<td>Hallo.</td>\\n<td>a</td>\\n<td>Zeichen können auch als Unicode-Wert angegeben werden (<code>U+0060</code> = <code>a</code>)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>.</code></td>\\n<td>Ja.</td>\\n<td>J, a, .</td>\\n<td>Der Punkt dient als Platzhalter für alle Zeichen. Somit werden alle Zeichen gefunden.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>.auch</code></td>\\n<td>Rauch<br/>Bauch<br/>auch</td>\\n<td>Rauch<br/>Bauch</td>\\n<td>Das Platzhalter Zeichen (<code>.</code>) findet sowohl ein <code>R</code>, wie auch ein <code>B</code>. Das Wort <code>auch</code> wird jedoch nicht gefunden, da das Platzhalterzeichen nicht gefüllt werden kann.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\.</code></td>\\n<td>Hallo.</td>\\n<td>.</td>\\n<td>Möchte man lediglich einen Punkt suchen, so wird dieser als <code>\\\\.</code> gesucht.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\\\\\</code></td>\\n<td>\\\\o/</td>\\n<td>\\\\</td>\\n<td>Back-Slash wird mit <code>\\\\\\\\</code> gefunden.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Eckige Klammern, Bereiche und Negation</h3>\\n<p>Eine Auflistung von alternativen Zeichen (Zeichenauswahl/Zeichenklasse) wird in Eckigen Klammern angegeben. Möchte man zum Beispiel nach einem <code>a</code> oder <code>b</code> suchen, so kann man dies als <code>[ab]</code> ausdrücken. Sollen ganze Mengen von Zeichen angegeben werden, so kann dies auch über eine <code>von–bis</code> Schreibweise getan werden. Also zum Beispiel findet <code>[a-d]</code> die Buchstaben <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code> und <code>d</code> (positive Zeichenklasse). Ebenso lässt sich ein Zeichenauswahl definieren, die alle Zeichen ausser die angegebenen enthält. So umschreibt der Ausdruck <code>[^A-Z]</code> zum Beispiel alle Zeichen ausser die Zeichen <code>A</code> bis <code>Z</code> (negierte Zeichenauswahl/Zeichenklasse).</p>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n<th>Erklärung</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>[a-zA-Z]</code></td>\\n<td>Hallo?</td>\\n<td>H, a, l, l, o</td>\\n<td>Findet alle Klein- und Grossbuchstaben nicht aber weitere Zeichen wie zum Beispiel das Fragezeichen.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Anwendungsbeispiel Platzhalter</h3>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Me.er</code></td>\\n<td>Meier<br/>Meyer<br/>Maier <br/>Meder</td>\\n<td>Meier<br/>Meyer<br/>×<br/>×</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Anwendungsbeispiel Zeichenklassen</h3>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>M[ae][yi]er</code></td>\\n<td>Mayer<br/>Maier<br/>Meyer<br/>Meier<br/>Meder</td>\\n<td>Mayer<br/>Maier<br/>Meyer<br/>Meier<br/>×</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>M[ae][^yi]er</code></td>\\n<td>Mayer<br/>Maier<br/>Meyer<br/>Meier<br/>Meder</td>\\n<td>×<br/>×<br/>×<br/>×<br/>Meder</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Wiederholungsfaktoren</h3>\\n<p>Wiederholungsfaktoren – auch Quantoren genannt – geben an, wie oft ein Ausdruck gefunden werden kann.

So findet ein Ausdruck wie <code>a.*z</code> alle Stellen die mit <code>a</code> beginnen und mit <code>z</code> enden ungeachtet dessen, ob vor dem letzten <code>z</code> weitere <code>z</code> stehen. Dieses Verhalten kann mit einem Fragezeichen (<code>?</code>) hinter einem Quantor unterbunden werden (Bsp: <code>.*?</code>).</p>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n<th>Erklärung</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>h.*r</code></td>\\n<td>horrortheater</td>\\n<td>horrortheater</td>\\n<td>Findet im Wort die längste Entsprechung, welche nicht <code>hor</code>, nicht <code>horr</code> und auch nicht <code>horror</code> ist.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>h.*?r</code></td>\\n<td>horrortheater</td>\\n<td>hor<br/>heater</td>\\n<td>Findet nun die kürzeste Entsprechung (<code>hor</code>).
