Zudem gibt es im Semester mehrere Punkte, an denen die Studierenden Rückmeldung zu Ihrer persönlichen Arbeit erhalten können. Die Prüfungsexperten sind in keiner dieser Prozessphasen involviert. Die Arbeit ist  selbständig zu erarbeiten und wird von einem Mentorat begleitet.</p>\\n<h3>Aufbau der Arbeit</h3>\\n<p>Die Arbeit wird frei nach den Vorstellungen der Studierenden strukturiert. Je nach Thema und Art der Arbeit kann die Methode oder der Aufbau variieren. Die Informationsarchitektur und die ganze Arbeit soll nicht künstlerischer, sondern grafischer und dienender Natur sein. Somit gelten übliche Herangehensweisen und Regeln für informierende Gestaltung. Die Arbeit muss vollständig in einem Browser zugänglich sein.</p>\\n<h3>Umfang</h3>\\n<p>Die User-Experience muss mindestens 15 Minuten umschliessen, wenn die Diplomarbeit «vollständig» konsumiert/erlebt wird (wiederkehrende Elemente werden nicht angerechnet). Es müssen mindestens vier Medientypen tragend berücksichtigt werden. Dazu zählen: Text, Bild, Video, Creative-Code, Audio, 3D im Browser, Interaktions Mechaniken wie Games/Wizards/Chats/…\\nDa die Website möglichst lange zugänglich sein soll, sind alle Teile der Website selber zu hosten und Interaktion mit externen Diensten ist nicht gestattet oder bedarf einer Bewilligung durch die Lehrgangskoordination.</p>\\n<h3>Mentorat</h3>\\n<p>Die Aufgabe des Mentorats ist es, den Studierenden eine Rückmeldung während des Prozesses auf ihre gestalterische und inhaltliche Arbeit zu geben.<br>\\nZum Mentorat sind alle Dozierenden berechtigt, die am Unterricht des Studiengangs beteiligt waren. Externe Mentorate können von den Studierenden zuhanden der Lehrgangskoordination vorgeschlagen werden und werden durch diese bewilligt.\\nFür das Mentorat stehen pro Person 7 Stunden (nicht Lektionen) zur Verfügung. Es wird empfohlen dieses Zeitbudget in mehrere persönliche kurze Sitzungen und für deren Vorbereitung zu nutzen. Die Mentorierenden sind angehalten sich an die Zeitvorgaben zu halten, da sonst ein unterschiedlicher Betreuungsgrad zwischen den Studierenden entsteht.\\nDie Mentorierenden melden den Prozess anhand eines Fragebogens an die Lehrgangskoordination zurück.\\nBei Anfragen an externe Dozierende kann eine Entschädigung von Fr. 840.– in Aussicht gestellt werden.</p>\\n<h3>Zeitlicher Ablauf</h3>\\n<style>\\n.nobreak {\\n  white-space: nowrap;\\n}\\n\\n.tab-spaced td,\\n.tab-spaced th {\\n  vertical-align: top;\\n  padding-right: 1rem;\\n}\\n\\n.tab-spaced td:last-child,\\n.tab-spaced th:last-child {\\n  padding-right: 0;\\n}\\n</style>\\n<div class=\\\"tab-spaced\\\">\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Zeit</th>\\n<th>Task</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>22. 2. 2020</td>\\n<td>Diplom-Aufgabe abgeben</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>4. 4. 2020</td>\\n<td>Abgabe eines kurzen Exposés als <a href=\\\"https://github.com/logrinto/IAD2017.diplom/issues\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">GitHub-Issue</a> mit Thema/Projekt, Zeitplan sowie Mentoratswunsch.

Einige Seiten sind in der Gestaltung offen und besitzen mehr einen künstlerischen Wert und helfen mit ihrer visuellen Darstellung nicht wirklich der Schriftauswahl.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../img/specimen/DaltonMaag/daltonmaag-01-cover.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"../img/specimen/DaltonMaag/daltonmaag-02-font-interface.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"../img/specimen/DaltonMaag/daltonmaag-03-font-glyphes.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"../img/specimen/DaltonMaag/daltonmaag-04-font-design.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"../img/specimen/DaltonMaag/daltonmaag-05-font-design.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\"></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"diplomstudiengang-zhdk\\\">Diplomstudiengang ZHdK</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h3>Inhaltliche Teile</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Angaben zum Autor</li>\\n<li>Gedanken und Ausgangslage</li>\\n<li>Erstellungsprozess</li>\\n<li>Symbolbibliothek</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Zweck und Analyse</h3>\\n<p>Das kleine Büchlein beinhaltet 11 verschiedene Fonts, welche im Nachdiplomsstudiengang «CAS Schriftgestaltung 12/13» an der ZHdK als Diplomarbeit entstanden sind. Zweck dieser kleinen Sammlung ist das Endresultat der Diplomarbeit als Sammlung zu präsentieren. Im Zentrum stehen die Gedankengänge die zum Endresultat geführt haben. Die Fonts befinden sich alle noch am Anfang ihrer Entwicklung, einzelne wurden weiterverfolgt und werden heute zum Kauf angeboten. Ein Beispiel hierfür ist die Cast von Dominique Kerber.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../img/specimen/ZHdK/aussenseite.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"../img/specimen/ZHdK/innenseite_1_Schriftanalyse.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"../img/specimen/ZHdK/Innenseite_2_Symbole.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"../img/specimen/ZHdK/Innenseite_3.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\"></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"eames\\\">Eames</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h3>Inhaltliche Teile</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Schnitte Auflistung</li>\\n<li>Kurzgeschichte, Intention</li>\\n<li>Fotos mit Anwendungen</li>\\n<li>Gesetzter Text in Anwendungen</li>\\n<li>Kombinationen mit Sonderzeichen als Deko-Elemente und diverse farbige Variationen</li>\\n<li>Zeichenmuster</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Zweck</h3>\\n<p>Der Verkauf der Schrift steht im Vordergrund.<br>\\nDie Dokumentation ermöglicht einen Einblick in viele mögliche Anwendungen diese Schriftfamilie.</p>\\n<h3>Analyse</h3>\\n<p>Das ist keinen Schriftenmuster in klassischem Sinn.

Diese Schrift wurde im Jahr 1907/1908 entwickelt und hatte das Ziel die Effizienz der Satzherstellung zu steigern, besonders bei Zeitschriften und Zeitungen.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../img/specimen/BibSG/Cover.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"../img/specimen/BibSG/Inhalt.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"../img/specimen/BibSG/Schriftmuster.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"specimen\\\"></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"offizin-haag-drugulin\\\">Offizin Haag-Drugulin</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h3>Inhaltliche Teile</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Inhaltsverzeichnis ist nach Einsatz der Schriften und Schriftart unterteilt</li>\\n<li>Als Einstieg einen Einblick in die Geschichte der Schrift</li>\\n<li>Dann folgen die Schriftmuster.

Der Herausgeber vom Year Book of Type ist slanted und vertrieben wird es von niggli. Auf slanted.de wird man mit Inspiration über Fonts überschüttet, der Blog bietet auch reichlich an Informationen sowie gibt es die Magazine die 4x jährlich erscheinen.

Ausgabegerät in eine Pixel-Matrix umgesetzt werden müssen. Diese Umrechnung von Vektoren zu Pixel kann auf verschiedene Arten geschehen. Die dafür zuständige Software wird Renderer genannt und ist je nach Hersteller unterschiedlich und liefert für die selben Vektoren unterschiedliche Ergebnisse.</p>\\n<h3>Grösse in Pixel</h3>\\n<p>Die Darstellungsgrösse einer Schrift wird in PPM (pixels per em) gemessen. Also wie viele Pixel das Geviert (vertikaler Raumbedarf) einnimmt. Wird also ein Font auf eine Schriftgrösse von 20 Pixel eingestellt, so ist der vertikale Raumbedarf 20 Pixel hoch. Das effektive Schriftbild (Schwärzung) ist jedoch im allgemeinen kleiner und von Schrift zu Schrift verschieden. Siehe <a href=\\\"../font-anatomy/\\\">Fonts · Eigenschaften</a>.\\nEine Fontdatei hat intern ein ein Koordinatensystem, welches sich in Einheiten pro Geviert berechnet bei PostScript-basierten Schriften ist dies meist 1000 UPM (units per em) und bei TrueType-basierten Schriften meist 2048 UPM.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"col_6of12\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"grid w80p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/normal/Arial_a_outline.png\\\" alt=\\\"Buchstabe a als Outline\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>Font als Outline</h4>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"col_6of12_last\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"grid w80p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/normal/Arial_a_no_hint.png\\\" alt=\\\"Buchstabe a als Pixel ohne Hinting\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>12 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – S/W</h4>\\n<p>Gerendert werden alle Pixel die zu mindestens\\n50% innerhalb der Kontur liegen (ohne Hinting).</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<h3>Auflösung</h3>\\n<p>Je höher die Auflösung eines Buchstaben ist, um so klarer nähert sich die Pixel-Darstellung an die Vektorform an.\\nEine höhere Auflösung pro Buchstabe kann erreicht werden, indem die Grösse des Buchstabens oder die Auflösung des Ausgabegeräts erhöht wird.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize upscale\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_a_waterfall@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Arial as in s/w gerendert\\\"></p>\\n<h4>8 bis 48 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h4>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"darstellung-ohne-graustufen\\\">Darstellung ohne Graustufen</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"grid w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_word_waterfall_8_18px@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Textworte in Arial als s/w in 8–18px mit Microsoft Renderer\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h3>8 bis 18 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h3>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Bei kleinen Schriften oder aber bei gewissen Display-Technologien kann es sinnvoll sein, Schrift nur mit S/W darzustellen.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid upscale\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_Hamburge_8px@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Textwort in Arial als s/w in 8px mit Microsoft Renderer\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h3>8 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h3>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid upscale\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_Hamburge_24px@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Textwort in Arial als s/w in 24px mit Microsoft Renderer\\\"></p>\\n<h3>24 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h3>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Unterschiede im Rendering</h3>\\n<p>Bei der S/W-Darstellung von Schrift sind die Unterschiede zwischen verschiedenen Renderern viel weniger stark erkennbar als bei einer Darstellung mit Graustufen.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"col_4of12\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/FreeType_BW_Arial_a_13px@100x.png\\\" alt=\\\"a in Arial als s/w in 13px mit FreeType Renderer – 2014\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>FreeType-Renderer – S/W</h4>\\n<p>13 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"col_4of12\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_a_13px@100x.png\\\" alt=\\\"a in Arial als s/w in 13px mit Microsoft Renderer – 2014\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>MS-Renderer – S/W</h4>\\n<p>13 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"col_4of12_last\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Apple_BW_Arial_a_13px@100x.png\\\" alt=\\\"a in Arial als s/w in 13px mit Apple Renderer – 2014\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>Apple-Renderer – S/W</h4>\\n<p>13 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"hinting\\\">Hinting</h2>\\n<p>Über spezielle Instruktionen wird die Kontur einer Schrift so verformt, dass die Darstellung besser auf ein Pixel-Grid passt.

Als das World Wide Web 1993 durch das CERN frei gegeben wird, war die Formatierung noch nicht durch einen Gestalter zu beeinflussen. Lediglich der Browser bestimmte das aussehen. Mit der Einführung von CSS im Jahre 1996 wurde dann die Möglichkeit geschaffen, Schriften einem Inhalt zu zuweisen. Allerdings musste der entsprechende Font bereits auf dem Zielgerät installiert sein. Bereits 1997 ermöglichte Microsoft mit damaliger Technologie in Ihrem Browser das Laden von Fonts über das Internet. Somit wurde es möglich, eigene Schriften einzusetzen. Doch diese Technologie war nur auf Internet Explorer (Windows) verfügbar und auch von den Font-Anbietern sehr schlecht akzeptiert. Erst im Jahre 2009 wurde auf Grundlage von OpenType ein neues Format namens «WOFF» (Web Open Font Format) entwickelt. Dieses Format wurde sehr schnell von Browser-Herstellern und von Font-Anbietern akzeptiert, so dass heute Problemlos auf allen wichtigen Browsern der vom Gestalter gewünschte Font dynamisch in die Seite geladen werden kann.</p>\\n<h3>Web Safe Fonts (Systemfonts)</h3>\\n<p>Unter Systemfonts wird häufig eine Auswahl an Schriften verstanden, die zu einer sehr hohen Wahrscheinlichkeit auf dem Betriebssystem installiert sind, auf dem ein Browser eine Website darstellt. Somit ist der Browser in der Lage diesen Font zu verwenden und es muss kein zusätzlicher Font übertragen werden. Die Auswahl dieser Fonts ist sehr beschränkt und variiert stark von Betriebssystem zu Betriebssystem. Um dennoch die Gestaltung mehr oder weniger unter Kontrolle zu behalten, werden in einem CSS sogenannte Fallbacks angegeben. Das heisst, wenn eine Schrift nicht vorhanden ist, so kommt eine andere zum Einsatz.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel</h4>\\n<p>CSS-Definition mit Font-Fallbacks:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\np {\\n  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<p>Es wird versucht zuerst Arial einzusetzen. Wenn keine Arial vorhanden ist, soll Helvetica zum Einsatz kommen und sonst eine beliebige Serifenlose.</p>\\n<h3>Verbreitung und Vorteile von Webfonts</h3>\\n<p>Meist kommt bei Webfonts das WOFF (Web Open Font Format) zum Einsatz. Seit 2014 sind auch die besser komprimierten WOFF 2.0 Dateien im Gebrauch, die heute von allen modernen Browsern unterstützt werden. Auch ältere Browser können mit älteren Font-Formaten (EOT)  Schriften einbinden.\\nVerfügt man über eine Lizenz eines Webfonts, so kann diese Schrift dynamisch zur Seite hinzugeladen werden. Der Gestalter weiss somit, wie seine Seite aussehen wird und kann die Typografie vollständig kontrollieren.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Fallback</h4>\\n<p>Damit der Webfont von möglichst vielen Browsern gelesen werden kann, werden diverse Fallbacks definiert.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>CSS-Definition für Webfonts:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\n@font-face {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans';\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot'); /* IE9 */\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), /* IE6 - IE8 */\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff2') format('woff2'), /* Modern Browsers */\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff') format('woff'), /* OK Browsers */\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.ttf') format('truetype'); /* Safari, Android, iOS */\\n  font-weight: normal; <!–– ** ––>\\n  font-style: normal;\\n}\\n\\np {\\n  font-family: \\\"Open Sans\\\", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h4>Beispiel google-Fonts</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans');\\n\\np {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Unicode Range</h3>\\n<p>Möchte man nur eine speziefische Auswahl an Buchstaben (Subset) eines Fonts von einer anderen Font-Datei beziehen, so kann dies mittels <code>unicode-range</code> gemacht werden. Dies ist vor allem nützlich, wenn wichtige Zeichen in einem Font fehlen (beispielsweise geschütztes schmales Leerzeichen) und von einer anderen Datei bezogen werden müssen.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel</h4>\\n<p>CSS-Definition mit <code>unicode-range</code> aus zwei font-faces:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\n@font-face {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans';\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot');\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff2') format('woff2'),\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff') format('woff'),\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.ttf') format('truetype');\\n  font-weight: normal;\\n  font-style: normal;\\n  unicode-range: U+000-5FF; /* Latin glyphs */  <!–– ** ––>\\n}\\n\\n@font-face {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans';\\n  src: url('special-web.eot');\\n  src: url('special-web.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),\\n  url('special-web.woff2') format('woff2'),\\n  url('special-web.woff') format('woff'),\\n  url('special-web.ttf') format('truetype');\\n  font-weight: normal;\\n  font-style: normal;\\n  unicode-range: U+0061; /* overwrite for letter a */  <!–– ** ––>\\n}\\n\\np {\\n  font-family: \\\"Open Sans\\\", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h3>OpenType features</h3>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Links</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://helpx.adobe.com/typekit/using/open-type-syntax.html#ordn\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Übersicht über die OpenType-Features von Adobe</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/font-feature-settings/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Anwendung – css-tricks</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">MDN</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://blog.bramp.net/post/2018/01/21/google-font-features/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Google vs. Font Features</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n<p>Auch im Web sind OpenType features wie Ligaturen oder verschiedenen Zahlensets möglich.

Somit konnte auf die Umstände der Anzeige (Bildschirmgrösse, Gerät, …) reagiert werden. Dieses Konzept war jedoch technisch nicht ausgereift genug für produktive Systeme.

Adobe, Google, Microsoft und Andere haben zugesagt diesen Standard bald in Ihre Software-Produkte zu integireren. Neben diversen eher technischen Erneuerungen ist vor allem die Möglichkeit für «Variable Fonts» für Gestalter heraus zu streichen. Mit dieser Funktion können Fonts mehrere so genannte Design-Achsen haben. Man kann also Fonts so einrichten, dass Sie zum Beispiel von ganz Light zu super Black stuffenlos (oder mit vom Designer gewählten Stufen) einstellbar sind. Aber auch andere Design-Achsen lassen sich frei vom Schriftdesinger bestimmen. Diese Technologie erinnert an die «Multiple master fonts» (1991), jedoch wird sich der neue Standard wohl besser verbreiten als die damalige Technologie.</p>\\n<h3>CSS und Web</h3>\\n<p>Im Moment werden Variable Fonts gerade in die Software-Produkte eingebaut. Erste Test-Versionen sind für Entwickler zugägnlich. Folgende CSS-Attribute sind vom Standard vorgesehen:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>font-weight</code> – Schriftstärke als Zahl von 1–999</li>\\n<li><code>font-stretch</code> – Schriftbreite in % (50% = Condesed, 200% Extended)</li>\\n<li><code>font-style</code> – Schriftlage zwischen -90° und +90°</li>\\n<li><code>font-optical-sizing</code> – Optische Schriftgrösen ein- oder ausschalten</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br>\\n<p>Daneben lassen sich aber auch weitere Werte-Achsen wie folgt definieren;</p>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<p>Hier wird jeweils eine Werte-Achse mit vier Buchstaben (vom Designer bestimmt) mit einem Wert angewandt.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\np {\\n    font-variation-settings: \\\"wdth\\\" 600, \\\"wght\\\" 200, \\\"opsz\\\" 48;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"fonts-finden-testen\\\">Fonts finden &amp; testen</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Mieten von Desktop-Fonts</h4>\\n<p>Auf fontstand.com können Desktop-Fonts gemietet werden. Dies ermöglicht Entwürfe dem Kunden vor zu legen, ohne den Font gekauft zu haben.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Fonts für Web- und Screendesign können von fast allen grossen und kleinen Font-Foundrys erworben werden. Es gibt vereinzelt Schriften, die (noch) nicht für den Web-Einsatz lizenziert werden können, dies ist jedoch eher die Ausnahme. Für Anwendungen ausserhalb des Webs – aber auf Screens – gibt es eher wenige Anbieter. So bietet zum Beispiel Linotype auch für eBooks, Apps und Server-Anwendungen Lizenzen. Diese Lizenztypen sind jedoch bei anderen Firmen oft nur mit Verhandlungen zu erwerben und es gibt keine standardisierten Prozesse.\\nDas Vorgehen zur Recherche von neuen Schriften unterscheidet sich nicht wesentlich vom finden von Schriften für den Print-Bereich. Sucht man eine Schrift, deren Name schon bekannt ist, so kann direkt zum Anbieter gesprungen werden. Ist man eher auf der Suche nach einem bestimmten Stil, kann eine Font-Plattform wie myfonts.com genutzt werden um ein entsprechendes Design zu finden.</p>\\n<h3>Testen</h3>\\n<p>Beim Suchen von Schriften ist es ratsam, die Schrift möglichst in einem Live-Preview auf die Tauglichkeit am Bildschirm zu prüfen. Deshalb können Fonts bei immer mehr Anbietern entweder auf der Seite getestet werden, oder aber Sie kooperieren mit Test-Platformen wie zum Beispiel typecast.com. Bei solch einem Dienst kann bereits vor dem Kauf geprüft werden, ob die Schrift bei gewünschter Anwendung, Grösse und Schriftmischung auf dem Screen funktioniert.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h3>Vor dem Kauf testen</h3>\\n<p>Auf typecast.com können Text-Layouts bereits vor dem Kauf einer Schrift definiert und editiert werden.\\nDies erleichtert die Wahl eines geeigneten Fonts und zudem kann dem Kunden bereits ein Eindruck der fertigen Site vermittelt werden.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"imageline\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/typecast.png\\\" alt=\\\"Fonts mit typecast.com testen\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"fontlizenzen\\\">Fontlizenzen</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Mieten (pro Monat)</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.fonts.com/unlimited#pricing\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">fonts.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://typekit.com/plans\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Typekit</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Fonts einmalig kaufen</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.urwpp.de/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">→ URW++</a> (zeitlich beschränkt)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.fontshop.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">→ Fontshop</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Views kaufen</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.linotype.com/de/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">→ linotype.com</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n<p>Es gibt grundsätzlich drei verschiedene Arten von kommerziellen Font-Lizenzen:</p>\\n<h3>Miet-Lizenzen</h3>\\n<p>Beim mieten von Lizenzen wird meist ein View-Volumen pro Monat gekauft unabhängig jedoch von der Anzahl der Fonts. So kann zum Beispiel bei fonts.com ein Account erworben werden, der 50 000 Pageviews pro Monat auf einer Domain erlaubt. Wird diese Zahl überschritten, muss auf ein höherer Preisplan gewechselt werden. Oft kann ein Account für diverse Projekte gleichzeitig verwendet werden. Die Fonts sind beim Anbieter gehostet.</p>\\n<h3>Einmalige Lizenzkosten</h3>\\n<p>Bei immer wenigen Anbietern kann eine Lizenz einmalig erworben werden. Bei einer solchen Lizenz wird diee Schrift meist auf dem eigenen Server installiert und der Schriftenanbieter vertraut darauf, dass der Käufer die Anzahl Views pro Monat, für die Lizenziert wurde, nicht überschritten wird.</p>\\n<h3>Kaufen von Views</h3>\\n<p>Es gibt Anbieter, die Views verkaufen. Das heisst, dass mit jedem Besuch einer Webseite mit dem Font das erworbene «Konto» um ein View reduziert wird. Somit muss die Schrift von Zeit zu Zeit wieder mit neuen Views aktiviert werden, so dass immer genügend Views vorhanden sind. Oder aber das Konto erneuert sich immer am Ende des Monats neu.</p>\\n<h3>Zeichensatz</h3>\\n<p>Wird die Schrift auf einer Seite eingesetzt, bei der viele Sprachen oder sonst spezielle Zeichen vorkommen, so ist es empfehlenswert zu Prüfen, ob die Schrift auch den nötigen Zeichensatz abdeckt. Auch OpenType-Features werden von den Schriftherstellern normalerweise vor dem Kauf angegeben.</p>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"freefonts-kommerzielle-fonts\\\">Freefonts – Kommerzielle Fonts</h2>\\n<p>Es gibt von diversen Font Foundries, Firmen und Enthusiasten qualitativ sehr hochwertige und gute Schriften, die frei verfügbar sind. Dabei gibt es diverse Abstufungen. Es gibt ganze Schriftfamilien, die frei sind, dann gibt es Schriftfamilien, bei denen einzelne Schnitte frei sind, oder es gibt Fonts, bei denen ein gewisser Zeichenumfang frei ist. Damit nicht bei den einzelnen Stellen im Web nach den Fonts gesucht werden muss, empfiehlt es sich, Portale zu verwenden, die einem die verschiedenen Fonts sortiert präsentieren oder eine schnelle Suche ermöglichen. Auch bieten solche Portale zum Teil die Möglichkeit, die Fonts gleich von deren Server zu laden (google Fonts) oder gewisse Konvertierungen für den Webgebrauch (fontsquirrel) zu erledigen.\\nDie benötige Fontlizenz für eine Website sollte mit dem Kunden geklärt werden und bereits in der Offerte sollte geklärt sein, wer die Lizenz zu erwerben hat.</p>\\n<h3>Kunde oder Agentur</h3>\\n<p>Aus finanzieller Überlegung kann es attraktiv sein, die Schriftlizenzen für alle Kunden über ein Konto der Agentur zu kaufen. So können die Kosten auf die verschiedenen Webprojekte umgelegt werden. Dies hat jedoch auch den Nachteil, dass die Agentur die Verantwortung gegenüber dem Kunden hat, den Account zu bezahlen und pflegen.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h4>fonts.com</h4>\\n<p>Im nebenstehenden Beispiel sieht man, dass für $32 pro Monat eine Million Views für beliebig viele Domains erworben werden kann.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/fontcom_subscription.png\\\" alt=\\\"Abonnement für fonts.com\\\"></p>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"iconfonts\\\">Iconfonts</h2>\\n<p>Icons werden auf Websites oft verwendet um Inhalte schneller und einfacher zugänglich zu machen. Aus technischer Sicht ist es relativ einfach – für einen Programmierer – diese Icons in einen Font zu konvertieren. Zudem haben solche Icons den Vorteil, dass Sie auf vielen Betriebsystemen und Browsern funktionieren und vektorbasiert aufgebaut sind. Als Nachteil ist zu beklagen, dass für die Accessibility (Menschen mit Behinderung einen Zugang ermöglichen) es oftmals keine gute Idee ist, die Icons mit Schrift zu machen, da die Zeichen dann als Inhalt verstanden werden und zum Beispiel Screen-Reader damit Probleme haben können.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h3>Iconfonts optimieren</h3>\\n<p>Fontello.com bietet die Möglichkeit aus diversen freien Icon-Fonts sich die nötigen Icons zu suchen und dann einen eignenen Icon-Font daraus zu erstellen.

Dies führ vor allem bei Mitternacht und Mittags oftmals zu verwirrung;</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>AM/PM</th>\\n<th><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ISO 8601</a></th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>11:59 AM</td>\\n<td>11:59</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>12:00 PM</td>\\n<td>12:00</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>11:59 PM</td>\\n<td>23:59</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>12:00 AM</td>\\n<td>24:00</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>Wir die AM/PM schreibweise verwendet, sollten keine führenden Nullstellen bei der Stunde verwendet werden um <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1229481014906511360\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Verwirrungen</a> zu vermeiden. Also nicht <s>02:45 PM</s> sondern 2:45 PM. Aber immer führende Nullstellen bei den Minuten.</p>\\n<h3>Schaltsekunde</h3>\\n<p>Da die Erde leicht langsamer um die eigene Achse rotiert, als die definierte Anzahl Sekunden (86400) in einem Tag (Sekunde zu schnell definiert), wird mit «Schaltsekunden» diese Abweichung kompensiert.</p>\\n<p>Der «Internationale Dienst für Erdrotation und Referenzsysteme» legt fest, wann eine zusätzliche Schaltsekunde eingefügt werden muss. Dies ist in unregelmässigen abständen und an unterschiedlichen Daten (meist 30. Juni oder 31. Dezember) der Fall.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel</h4>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-md\\\">31.12.2011 23:59:59\\n31.12.2011 23:59:60 ← Schaltsekunde\\n01.01.2012 00:00:00\\n</code></pre>\\n<br>\\n<p>Es gibt diverse Probleme mit Computer-Systemen und Schaltsekunden. <a href=\\\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/look-before-you-leap-december-31-2016-leap-second-on-aws/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Einige Firmen</a> sind dazu übergegangen, die Schaltsekunde über einen Tag zu verteilen um keine einundsechzigste Sekunde in einer Stunde haben zu müssen.</p>\\n<h3>Zeitzonen</h3>\\n<p>Durch die Erdrotation werden verschiedene Regionen der Welt zu unterschiedlichen Zeiten der Sonne zugewandt (Tag). Die Zeitmessung wird jedoch meist daran gerichtet, dass man um Mittag den höchsten Sonnenstand möchte. Somit muss die Abweichung über so genannte Zeitzonen kompensiert werden:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/World_Time_Zones_Map.png\\\" alt=\\\"Zeitzonen\\\">\\nQuelle: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Time_Zones_Map.png\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\n<p>Einige Regionen und politische Einheiten sind trotz grosser Ausdehnung in den Längengraden als einheitliche Zeitzone zusammengefasst. So ist zum Beispiel ganz China in der gleichen Zeitzone (UTC+8). Dadurch ergibt sich beim Grenzüberschritt nach Afganistan der grösste «Zeitsprung» der Erde von -3.5 Stunden.</p>\\n<p>Es kann vorkommen, dass Zeitzonen «unlogisch» und schnell ändern. Beispiel hierfür ist Australien, welches im Jahr 2000 für die dauer der Olymischen Sommerspiele und im Jahr 2006 für die «Commonwealth Games» ihre Zeitzonen vereinheitlichte.</p>\\n<h3>UTC – Coordinated Universal Time</h3>\\n<p>Seit 1884 wird der <a href=\\\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullmeridian\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Nullmeridian</a> basierend auf der Ortschaft Greenwich (England) verwendet um die Zeitmessung international standardisiert zu koordinieren. Seit 1972 wird dabei von der Koordinierten Weltzeit (UTC – Coordinated Universal Time) gesprochen. Davor wurde der bis heute in England gebäruchliche Ausdruck Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) verwendet.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<p>Quelle: <a href=\\\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullmeridian\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Breitenkreis-und-Nullmeridian.png\\\" alt=\\\"Nullmeridian\\\"></p>\\n<h3>CET – Central European Time</h3>\\n<p>Die mitteleuropäische Zeit (MEZ) oder Central European Time (CET) ist die am meisten gebrauchte Zeitzone in Europa. Sie weist zur UTC-Zeit eine Offset von plus einer Stunde auf. Deshalb kann sie auch als UTC+1 geschrieben werden (siehe Sommerzeit).</p>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<p>Quelle: <a href=\\\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitteleurop%C3%A4ische_Zeit\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Time_zones_of_Europe.svg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\">\\nRegionen mit mitteleuropäische Zeit (MEZ) in rot markiert.</p>\\n<h3>Zeitzonen der USA</h3>\\n<p>Die USA hat <a href=\\\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitzonen_in_den_Vereinigten_Staaten\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">insgesammt 11 Zeitzonen</a>. Wobei meist nur von den vier Zeitzonen auf dem zusammenhängenden Festlandgebiet gesprochen wird:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Eastern Time Zone – UTC−05:00</li>\\n<li>Central Time Zone – UTC−06:00</li>\\n<li>Mountain Time Zone – UTC−07:00</li>\\n<li>Pacific Time Zone – UTC−08:00</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/US-Timezones-post-2007.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\">\\nQuelle: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US-Timezones-post-2007.png\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\n<h3>Computer &amp; Zeitzonen</h3>\\n<p>Auf vielen Servern wird bei der Installation keine automatische Zeitzone gestellt. Somit haben viele Server UTC als Standard. Bei Desktop-Computern wird meist mit Geolokation versucht die richtige Zeitzone zu finden.</p>\\n<h3>Sommerzeit</h3>\\n<p>In einigen Regionen der Welt wird in den Sommermonaten eine Sommerzeit (Daylight saving time – DST) eingeführt. Diese wird meist eine Stunde vor der üblichen Zeit gestellt. So ist die mitteleuropäische Zeit (MEZ) in den Wintermonaten UTC+1 und in den Sommermonaten UTC+2.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Schweiz</h4>\\n<p>Am 28. Mai 1978 wurde in einer Volksabstimmung (Referendum) beschlossen, dass man sich nicht mit der Sommerzeit den Nachbarstaaten anschliesst. Aufgrund massiver Probleme wurde die «Zeitinsel-Schweiz» per Gesetz ab 1. Januar 1981 dem Ausland angeglichen und das Chaos hatte ein Ende.<br>\\nQuelle: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/DST_Countries_Map.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\">\\nRegionen mit Sommerzeit in blau markiert. Bildquelle: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\n<p>Politische Entscheide können sehr schnell die Einführung oder Abschaffung von Sommerzeit beeinflussen. <a href=\\\"https://www.maghreb-post.de/gesellschaft/marokko-regierung-schafft-die-zeitumstellung-ab/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">In Maroko</a> wurde zum Beispiel am 27. Oktober 2018 beschlossen, dass die Winterzeit am Folgetag nicht mehr zur Anwendung kommen wird. Dies führte zu diversen Problemen, da die Umstellung sehr kurzfristig war.</p>\\n<h4>Abschaffung in der EU</h4>\\n<p>Das EU-Parlament entschied im März 2019, dass nur noch bis 2021 eine Sommerzeitumstellung erfolgen soll. Danach steht es den Mitgliedstaaten frei ob sie in Normal- oder Sommerzeit ihre weiter fahren. Es bleibt zu hoffen, dass die Staaten sich einigen können, so dass es weiterhin eine grosse geschlossene Zeitzone (MEZ) in der EU gibt.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"datum-kalender\\\">Datum &amp; Kalender</h2>\\n<p>Der <a href=\\\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorianischer_Kalender\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">gregorianische Kalender</a> ist weltweit der meist gebrauchte Kalender und wurde im Jahr 1582 von Papst Gregor XIII verordnet. Dabei hat das Jahr (Umlauf der Erde um die Sonne) im Durchschnitt etwa 365,25 Tage und diese werden auf 12 Monate verteilt. Die Schaltjahre haben 366 Tage, sonstige Jahre werden mit 365 Tagen geführt.</p>\\n<h3>Regeln für Schaltjahre</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>1. Regel: Jahreszahl durch vier ganzzahlig teilbaren = Schaltjahr</li>\\n<li>2. Regel: Jahreszahl durch 100 ganzzahlig teilbaren = kein Schaltjahr (1. Regel überlegen)</li>\\n<li>3. Regel: Jahreszahl durch 400 ganzzahlig teilbaren = Schaltjahr (2. Regel überlegen)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Jahr-2000-Problem</h3>\\n<p>Im Jahr 2000 gab es zwei Probleme; Das kleinere Problem war, dass diverse Software das Schaltjahr im Jahr 2000 nicht korrekt berechnet hatten und fälschlich keine Schaltjahr annahmen. Das grössere Problem war, dass teils Jahreszahlen nur zweistellig abgespeichert wurden. Also anstatt zum Beispiel 1999 wurde nur 99 abgespeichert. Beim Jahreswechsel wurde somit neu 00 abgespeichert, was anstatt 2000 als 1900 interpretiert wurde.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"numerische-notation-von-daten\\\">Numerische Notation von Daten</h2>\\n<p>Bei der numerischen Schreibweise für ein Datum gibt es diverse Standards. Es muss die jeweilige Konvention passend zur Anwendung und zum Land berücksichtigt werden.</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Standard</th>\\n<th>Format</th>\\n<th>Beispiel</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>USA</td>\\n<td>MM/DD/YYYY</td>\\n<td>03/29/2000</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>ISO 8601</td>\\n<td>YYYY-MM-DD</td>\\n<td>2000-03-29</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>DIN 5008</td>\\n<td>YYYY-MM-DD oder DD.MM.YYYY</td>\\n<td>2000-03-29 / 29.3.2000</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h2 id=\\\"unix-timestamp\\\">Unix-Timestamp</h2>\\n<p>In Computer-Systemen wird häufig eine Zeit als «Unix time» gespeichert. Dabei handelt es sich um eine Ganzzahl (signed integer) welche die vergangenen Sekunden seit 1. Januar 1970 um 0:00 Uhr räpresentiert. Die Zahl kann ein Vorzeichen haben, also auch einen Minus-Bereich abdecken und somit Ereignisse vor 1970 repräsentieren.</p>\\n<h3>Beispiele</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>31. Dezember 1999, 23:59:59 = 946 684 799 000</li>\\n<li>22. November 1963, 18:30:00 = –192 778 200</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Jahr-2038-Problem</h3>\\n<p>Im Januar 2038 wird die Sekundenzahl so gross werden, dass die Zahl nicht mehr mit 32 Bit (vorzeichenbehaftete 32-Bit-Ganzzahl) gespeichert werden kann. Einige Computer-Systeme speichern jedoch noch immer in 32 Bit ab. Diese Systeme müssen bis spätestens dahin umgestellt werden. Neuere Systeme speichern Timestamps als 62-Bit-Wert ab. Somit kann noch für die nächsten paar Milliarden Jahre die Zahl problemlos abgespeichert werden.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<p>Quelle: <a href=\\\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahr-2038-Problem\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Year_2038_problem.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"zahlungsverkehr\\\">Zahlungsverkehr</h2>\\n<h2 id=\\\"besteuerung\\\">Besteuerung</h2>\\n<p>Viele Länder haben eine Steuer auf verkaufte Güter/Dienstleistung. Grundsätzlich kann davon ausgegangen werden, dass die Steuer im Land des Konsumenten/Käufers erhoben werden muss.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"mehrwertsteuer-in-der-schweiz-mwst\\\">Mehrwertsteuer in der Schweiz (MwSt)</h2>\\n<p>In der Schweiz gibt es drei Mehrwertsteuersätze. Je nach Produkt/Dienstleistung muss man einen der Sätze versteuern oder ist befreit von der Mehrwertsteuer. Bei Online-Shops gelten die selben Regeln wie an physischen Verkaufsstellen. Es ist empfehlenswert die Gesamtsumme inklusive Mehrwertsteuer anzugeben und dann je Mehrwertsteuer-Satz diese separat auszuweisen.</p>\\n<h3>Beispiel</h3>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/mwst.png\\\" alt=\\\"MwSt\\\"></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"bankverkehr\\\">Bankverkehr</h2>\\n<p>Heute wird im internationalen Bankverkehr häufig elektronisch Geld übermittelt. Dabei werdne häufig die Konten mittels IBAN (International Bank Account Number) angegeben. In Deutschland zum Beispiel ist die IBAN als ein Geheimnis zu wahren, da mittels IBAN Geld von einem Konto angefordert werden kann. Somit sollte diese Information nicht unbedingt öffentlich gemacht werden.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"checks\\\">Checks</h2>\\n<p>In den USA werden Banküberweisungen eher selten gemacht. Man schickt seinem Geschäftspartner einen Check, der dann berechtigt vom eigenen Konto den Betrag des Checks zu beziehen.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"paypal\\\">PayPal</h2>\\n<p>PayPal ist eines der am weitesten verbreiteten rein elektronischen Zahlungsmittel. PayPal ist relativ einfach in Shop-Systeme zu integrieren und auch Personen ohne PayPal-Konto können dann direkt via Kreditkarte bezahlen.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"kreditkarten\\\">Kreditkarten</h2>\\n<p>Um im eigenen Shop mit Kreditkarten zu bezahlen wird meist ein Kreditkarten-Prozessor eingesetzt. Diese Firmen haben Verträge mit den Kreditkartenbetreibern und wickeln den eigentlichen Zahlungsvorgang ab. Als Website-Betreiber kann ich zwischen diversen Betreibern wählen. Hier ein paar grosse Vertreter:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.six-payment-services.com/en/site/e-commerce/solutions/paymentsolution.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Saferpay/SIX</a> (im Schweizer Markt)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.datatrans.ch/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">datatrans</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://stripe.com/ch\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Stripe</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.shopify.de/zahlungsportal/schweiz\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">shopify</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Es fallen im allgemeinen Gebüren an, die der Shop-Betreiber zu bezahlen hat.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"twint\\\">Twint</h2>\\n<p>In der Schweiz gibt es einen breiten Bankenzusammenschluss für das elektronische Zahlungsmittel «Twint». Dieses kann relativ einfach in bestehende Shops integriert werden. Die Bezahlung erfolgt mittels einem QR-Code, der über die App am Smartphone gescannt und bestätigt werden kann.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"apple-pay-google-pay\\\">Apple-Pay &amp; Google Pay</h2>\\n<p>Neuere Smartphones habe in Hardware die Funktion einer Kreditkarte abgebildet.

So wird bei einem Smartphone der Zugang durch einen kleinen Bildschirm über eine Fingersteuerung gewährleistet, während man bei einem Desktop-Computer mit der Maus auf einem grossem Bildschirm navigiert.</p>\\n<h3>Strukturieren der Inhalte in Seiten</h3>\\n<p>Die meisten Websites gliedern Inhalte über Seiten.

Aber ein voll funktionsfähiger Browser, der einsatztauglich ist, ist unglaublich komplex. Es gibt Weltweit nur eine handvoll Projekte, die dies gemacht haben.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Die Parser, welche HTML interpretieren sind über Jahre gewachsen uns haben einen Beeindruckenden Funktionsumfang. Nicht nur HTML muss interpretiert werden, sondern diverse andere Teile müssen für den Renderer (Darstellung) verständlich gemacht werden. Dazu zählen  zum Beispiel:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Bild-Parser (jpg, gif, …)</li>\\n<li>Font-Parser</li>\\n<li>CSS-Parser</li>\\n<li>JavaScript-Parser</li>\\n<li>…</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Robustheit</h4>\\n<p>HTML-Parser sind so programmiert, dass gewisse Fehler im HTML vom Browser aufgefangen werden können.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel Robustheit</h4>\\n<p>Anstatt</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">p</span>&gt;</span>Hallo <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">em</span>&gt;</span>Welt!<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">em</span>&gt;</span><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">p</span>&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<br />\\n<p>könnte auch eine fehlerhafte Eingabe vom Browser korrigiert werden:\\n<br /></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">p</span>&gt;</span>Hallo <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">em</span>&gt;</span>Welt!\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>CSS Parser</h3>\\n<p>Auch der CSS Parser ist sehr fehlertolerant geschrieben.

Sie können als Filterkriterien in der Textsuche verwendet werden, indem der Text mit dem Muster des regulären Ausdrucks abgeglichen wird. So können Regeln definiert werden, die wesentlich flexibler sind als eine sture Suche nach einer fest vorgegebenen Zeichenfolge. In menschlicher Sprache ausgedrückt könnte zum Beispiel folgendes Suchmuster (Pattern) definiert werden: Suche alle Worte, die mit dem Zeichen <code>A</code> beginnen und dem Zeichen <code>r</code> enden (RegEx: <code>\\\\bA[^ ]*r</code>).</p>\\n<h3>Geschichte</h3>\\n<p>Reguläre Ausdrücke wurden 1956 vom Mathematiker Stephen Cole Kleene erstmalig beschrieben. Diese mathematische Notation (reguläre Mengen) entstammt der theoretischen Informatik und es handelt sich dabei um eine formale Sprache – also eine abstrakte Sprache, bei der nicht die Kommunikation im Vordergrund steht, sondern die mathematische Verwendung.</p>\\n<h3>Reguläre Ausdrücke, RegEx, GREP?</h3>\\n<p>Es gibt diverse Begriffe, die stellvertretend für reguläre Ausdrücke verwendet werden. Häufig wird auch in der deutschen Sprache der englische Begriff «regular expressions» benutzt. Alternativ auch die Kurzform davon; «RegEx». Der Begriff GREP (auch: grep, Grep) steht für «global/regular expression/print» und entspringt dem Kommando <code>g/re/p</code> des Unix-Standardeditors «ed». Alle diese Begriffe lassen sich synonym verwenden und bezeichnen das selbe.</p>\\n<h3>Bedeutung &amp; Implementierungen</h3>\\n<p>Fast alle Programmiersprachen und Betriebssysteme (Konsole/Terminal) unterstützen heute reguläre Ausdrücke und seit den 1960er Jahren werden diese oft für Mustererkennungen (Suchbegriffe) in Texteditoren und zur lexikalischen Analyse in diversen Bereichen der digitalen Datenverarbeitung eingesetzt. Je nach verwendeter Implementierung (Programm) können kleine Abweichungen in der Verwendung, im Umfang oder der Notation auftauchen. JavaScript unterstützt Reguläre Ausdrücke seit <a href=\\\"https://www-archive.mozilla.org/js/language/E262-3.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ECMAScript 3</a> aus dem Jahr 1999 und seit dem weiter entwickelt.\\nReguläre ausdrücke werden auch in der Bioinformatik eingesetzt. Ein Beispiel aus Wikipedia zeigt die Beschreibung eines Proteinmotivs:\\n<code>W-x(9,11)-[VFY]-[FYW]-x(6,7)-[GSTNE]-[GSTQCR]-[FYW]-R-S-A-P</code></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"suchen\\\">Suchen</h2>\\n<h3>Zeichen und Platzhalter</h3>\\n<p>Als Zeichenliterale bezeichnen wir ein oder mehrere Buchstaben, die in einem Suchmuster enthalten sind. Der Buchstabe <code>a</code> – als Beispiel – findet nur den Buchstaben <code>a</code> und ansonsten keine weiteren Zeichen. Zusätzlich zu den expliziten Literalen gibt es noch den Punkt (<code>.</code>) als Platzhalterzeichen. Der Punkt findet jedes beliebige Zeichen. Möchte man einen Punkt suchen, so wird dieser mit einem sogenannten Escape-Zeichen (<code>.</code>) eingegeben. Neben den expliziten Zeichen gibt es noch weitere Platzhalter, welche eine spezielle Bedeutung haben. Hier einige Beispiele:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\d</code></td>\\n<td>Ziffer</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\w</code></td>\\n<td>Buchstabe &amp; Ziffer</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\s</code></td>\\n<td>Leerraumzeichen</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\b</code></td>\\n<td>Wortgrenze*</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>$</code></td>\\n<td>Ende der Linie*</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>^</code></td>\\n<td>Anfang der Linie*</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Findet eine Position in einer Zeichenkette (auch: zero-width, zero-length)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n<th>Erklärung</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>a</code></td>\\n<td>Hallo.</td>\\n<td>a</td>\\n<td>Das <code>a</code> ist ein Zeichen ohne spezieller Funktion und wird somit auch im Text gefunden</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\x{0061}</code></td>\\n<td>Hallo.</td>\\n<td>a</td>\\n<td>Zeichen können auch als Unicode-Wert angegeben werden (<code>U+0060</code> = <code>a</code>)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>.</code></td>\\n<td>Ja.</td>\\n<td>J, a, .</td>\\n<td>Der Punkt dient als Platzhalter für alle Zeichen.

Möchte man zum Beispiel nach einem <code>a</code> oder <code>b</code> suchen, so kann man dies als <code>[ab]</code> ausdrücken. Sollen ganze Mengen von Zeichen angegeben werden, so kann dies auch über eine <code>von–bis</code> Schreibweise getan werden. Also zum Beispiel findet <code>[a-d]</code> die Buchstaben <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code> und <code>d</code> (positive Zeichenklasse). Ebenso lässt sich ein Zeichenauswahl definieren, die alle Zeichen ausser die angegebenen enthält. So umschreibt der Ausdruck <code>[^A-Z]</code> zum Beispiel alle Zeichen ausser die Zeichen <code>A</code> bis <code>Z</code> (negierte Zeichenauswahl/Zeichenklasse).</p>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n<th>Erklärung</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>[a-zA-Z]</code></td>\\n<td>Hallo?</td>\\n<td>H, a, l, l, o</td>\\n<td>Findet alle Klein- und Grossbuchstaben nicht aber weitere Zeichen wie zum Beispiel das Fragezeichen.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Anwendungsbeispiel Platzhalter</h3>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Me.er</code></td>\\n<td>Meier<br/>Meyer<br/>Maier <br/>Meder</td>\\n<td>Meier<br/>Meyer<br/>×<br/>×</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Anwendungsbeispiel Zeichenklassen</h3>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>M[ae][yi]er</code></td>\\n<td>Mayer<br/>Maier<br/>Meyer<br/>Meier<br/>Meder</td>\\n<td>Mayer<br/>Maier<br/>Meyer<br/>Meier<br/>×</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>M[ae][^yi]er</code></td>\\n<td>Mayer<br/>Maier<br/>Meyer<br/>Meier<br/>Meder</td>\\n<td>×<br/>×<br/>×<br/>×<br/>Meder</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Wiederholungsfaktoren</h3>\\n<p>Wiederholungsfaktoren – auch Quantoren genannt – geben an, wie oft ein Ausdruck gefunden werden kann.

Das heisst, dass immer die grösstmögliche Entsprechung gesucht wird. So findet ein Ausdruck wie <code>a.*z</code> alle Stellen die mit <code>a</code> beginnen und mit <code>z</code> enden ungeachtet dessen, ob vor dem letzten <code>z</code> weitere <code>z</code> stehen. Dieses Verhalten kann mit einem Fragezeichen (<code>?</code>) hinter einem Quantor unterbunden werden (Bsp: <code>.*?</code>).</p>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n<th>Erklärung</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>h.*r</code></td>\\n<td>horrortheater</td>\\n<td>horrortheater</td>\\n<td>Findet im Wort die längste Entsprechung, welche nicht <code>hor</code>, nicht <code>horr</code> und auch nicht <code>horror</code> ist.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>h.*?r</code></td>\\n<td>horrortheater</td>\\n<td>hor<br/>heater</td>\\n<td>Findet nun die kürzeste Entsprechung (<code>hor</code>).

Semester eine Diplomarbeit. Die Abschlussnote der Ausbildung wird dabei durch Thesis (20 %) und Diplom (80 %) bestimmt.\\nInhalte der Arbeit stehen unter einer <a href=\\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">CC-BY-SA 4.0 Lizenz</a> und werden publiziert. Es ist also darauf zu achten, dass keine Lizenzverstösse begangen werden.\\nProgrammcode der Arbeit stehen under der <a href=\\\"https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">MIT Lizenz</a> und werden publiziert.</p>\\n<h3>Ziele</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Gestalterisches Projekt zu einem selbstgewählten Thema erarbeiten.</li>\\n<li>Die Diplomarbeit kann auf den Erkenntnissen der  Thesisarbeit aufbauen.</li>\\n<li>Entscheide über Gestaltung und Arbeitsprozess müssen nachvollziehbar und professionell begründet sein.</li>\\n<li>Die Arbeit wird durch eine begleitende schriftliche Arbeit in einen Kontext eingeordnet (Umfang 3000 – 4000 Zeichen).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Prozess</h3>\\n<p>Die Studierenden wurden während ihrer Ausbildung immer wieder mit gestalterischen Arbeiten beauftragt und verstehen, wie eine solche Arbeit zu bewältigen ist. Zudem gibt es im Semester mehrere Punkte, an denen die Studierenden Rückmeldung zu Ihrer persönlichen Arbeit erhalten können. Die Prüfungsexperten sind in keiner dieser Prozessphasen involviert. Die Arbeit ist  selbständig zu erarbeiten und wird von einem Mentorat begleitet.</p>\\n<h3>Aufbau der Arbeit</h3>\\n<p>Die Arbeit wird frei nach den Vorstellungen der Studierenden strukturiert. Je nach Thema und Art der Arbeit kann die Methode oder der Aufbau variieren. Die Informationsarchitektur und die ganze Arbeit soll nicht künstlerischer, sondern grafischer und dienender Natur sein. Somit gelten übliche Herangehensweisen und Regeln für informierende Gestaltung. Die Arbeit muss vollständig in einem Browser zugänglich sein.</p>\\n<h3>Umfang</h3>\\n<p>Die User-Experience muss mindestens 15 Minuten umschliessen, wenn die Diplomarbeit «vollständig» konsumiert/erlebt wird (wiederkehrende Elemente werden nicht angerechnet). Es müssen mindestens vier Medientypen tragend berücksichtigt werden. Dazu zählen: Text, Bild, Video, Creative-Code, Audio, 3D im Browser, Interaktions Mechaniken wie Games/Wizards/Chats/…\\nDa die Website möglichst lange zugänglich sein soll, sind alle Teile der Website selber zu hosten und Interaktion mit externen Diensten ist nicht gestattet oder bedarf einer Bewilligung durch die Lehrgangskoordination.</p>\\n<h3>Mentorat</h3>\\n<p>Die Aufgabe des Mentorats ist es, den Studierenden eine Rückmeldung während des Prozesses auf ihre gestalterische und inhaltliche Arbeit zu geben.<br>\\nZum Mentorat sind alle Dozierenden berechtigt, die am Unterricht des Studiengangs beteiligt waren. Externe Mentorate können von den Studierenden zuhanden der Lehrgangskoordination vorgeschlagen werden und werden durch diese bewilligt.\\nFür das Mentorat stehen pro Person 7 Stunden (nicht Lektionen) zur Verfügung. Es wird empfohlen dieses Zeitbudget in mehrere persönliche kurze Sitzungen und für deren Vorbereitung zu nutzen. Die Mentorierenden sind angehalten sich an die Zeitvorgaben zu halten, da sonst ein unterschiedlicher Betreuungsgrad zwischen den Studierenden entsteht.\\nDie Mentorierenden melden den Prozess anhand eines Fragebogens an die Lehrgangskoordination zurück.\\nBei Anfragen an externe Dozierende kann eine Entschädigung von Fr. 840.– in Aussicht gestellt werden.</p>\\n<h3>Zeitlicher Ablauf</h3>\\n<style>\\n.nobreak {\\n  white-space: nowrap;\\n}\\n\\n.tab-spaced td,\\n.tab-spaced th {\\n  vertical-align: top;\\n  padding-right: 1rem;\\n}\\n\\n.tab-spaced td:last-child,\\n.tab-spaced th:last-child {\\n  padding-right: 0;\\n}\\n</style>\\n<div class=\\\"tab-spaced\\\">\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Zeit</th>\\n<th>Task</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>22. 2. 2020</td>\\n<td>Diplom-Aufgabe abgeben</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>4. 4. 2020</td>\\n<td>Abgabe eines kurzen Exposés als <a href=\\\"https://github.com/logrinto/IAD2017.diplom/issues\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">GitHub-Issue</a> mit Thema/Projekt, Zeitplan sowie Mentoratswunsch.

Knapp, prägnant, mit\\nklarer Struktur und vielen Bildern untermalt. Es wird mehr eine Geschichte erzählt und eben diese Geschichte mit dem Font zusammen verkauft,\\nals der Font alleine. So könnte ich mir am ehesten eine Präsentation im Web vorstellen, natürlich mit Interaktion angereichert.

Fonts</h2>\\n<h3>Vektor zu Pixel</h3>\\n<p>Heutige Fonts bestehen meist aus Vektor-Daten, die dann für die Anzeige an einem Ausgabegerät in eine Pixel-Matrix umgesetzt werden müssen. Diese Umrechnung von Vektoren zu Pixel kann auf verschiedene Arten geschehen. Die dafür zuständige Software wird Renderer genannt und ist je nach Hersteller unterschiedlich und liefert für die selben Vektoren unterschiedliche Ergebnisse.</p>\\n<h3>Grösse in Pixel</h3>\\n<p>Die Darstellungsgrösse einer Schrift wird in PPM (pixels per em) gemessen. Also wie viele Pixel das Geviert (vertikaler Raumbedarf) einnimmt. Wird also ein Font auf eine Schriftgrösse von 20 Pixel eingestellt, so ist der vertikale Raumbedarf 20 Pixel hoch. Das effektive Schriftbild (Schwärzung) ist jedoch im allgemeinen kleiner und von Schrift zu Schrift verschieden. Siehe <a href=\\\"../font-anatomy/\\\">Fonts · Eigenschaften</a>.\\nEine Fontdatei hat intern ein ein Koordinatensystem, welches sich in Einheiten pro Geviert berechnet bei PostScript-basierten Schriften ist dies meist 1000 UPM (units per em) und bei TrueType-basierten Schriften meist 2048 UPM.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"col_6of12\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"grid w80p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/normal/Arial_a_outline.png\\\" alt=\\\"Buchstabe a als Outline\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>Font als Outline</h4>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"col_6of12_last\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"grid w80p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/normal/Arial_a_no_hint.png\\\" alt=\\\"Buchstabe a als Pixel ohne Hinting\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>12 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – S/W</h4>\\n<p>Gerendert werden alle Pixel die zu mindestens\\n50% innerhalb der Kontur liegen (ohne Hinting).</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<h3>Auflösung</h3>\\n<p>Je höher die Auflösung eines Buchstaben ist, um so klarer nähert sich die Pixel-Darstellung an die Vektorform an.\\nEine höhere Auflösung pro Buchstabe kann erreicht werden, indem die Grösse des Buchstabens oder die Auflösung des Ausgabegeräts erhöht wird.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize upscale\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_a_waterfall@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Arial as in s/w gerendert\\\"></p>\\n<h4>8 bis 48 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h4>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"darstellung-ohne-graustufen\\\">Darstellung ohne Graustufen</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"grid w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_word_waterfall_8_18px@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Textworte in Arial als s/w in 8–18px mit Microsoft Renderer\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h3>8 bis 18 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h3>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Bei kleinen Schriften oder aber bei gewissen Display-Technologien kann es sinnvoll sein, Schrift nur mit S/W darzustellen.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid upscale\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_Hamburge_8px@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Textwort in Arial als s/w in 8px mit Microsoft Renderer\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h3>8 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h3>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid upscale\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_Hamburge_24px@10x.png\\\" alt=\\\"Textwort in Arial als s/w in 24px mit Microsoft Renderer\\\"></p>\\n<h3>24 Pixel Höhe (PPM)</h3>\\n<p>Microsoft Arial Unicode – MS-Renderer – S/W</p>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Unterschiede im Rendering</h3>\\n<p>Bei der S/W-Darstellung von Schrift sind die Unterschiede zwischen verschiedenen Renderern viel weniger stark erkennbar als bei einer Darstellung mit Graustufen.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"col_4of12\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/FreeType_BW_Arial_a_13px@100x.png\\\" alt=\\\"a in Arial als s/w in 13px mit FreeType Renderer – 2014\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>FreeType-Renderer – S/W</h4>\\n<p>13 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"col_4of12\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Microsoft_BW_Arial_a_13px@100x.png\\\" alt=\\\"a in Arial als s/w in 13px mit Microsoft Renderer – 2014\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>MS-Renderer – S/W</h4>\\n<p>13 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"col_4of12_last\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"w70p\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/Apple_BW_Arial_a_13px@100x.png\\\" alt=\\\"a in Arial als s/w in 13px mit Apple Renderer – 2014\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<h4>Apple-Renderer – S/W</h4>\\n<p>13 Pixel Höhe (PPM) – Microsoft Arial Unicode</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"hinting\\\">Hinting</h2>\\n<p>Über spezielle Instruktionen wird die Kontur einer Schrift so verformt, dass die Darstellung besser auf ein Pixel-Grid passt.

Als das World Wide Web 1993 durch das CERN frei gegeben wird, war die Formatierung noch nicht durch einen Gestalter zu beeinflussen. Lediglich der Browser bestimmte das aussehen. Mit der Einführung von CSS im Jahre 1996 wurde dann die Möglichkeit geschaffen, Schriften einem Inhalt zu zuweisen. Allerdings musste der entsprechende Font bereits auf dem Zielgerät installiert sein. Bereits 1997 ermöglichte Microsoft mit damaliger Technologie in Ihrem Browser das Laden von Fonts über das Internet. Somit wurde es möglich, eigene Schriften einzusetzen. Doch diese Technologie war nur auf Internet Explorer (Windows) verfügbar und auch von den Font-Anbietern sehr schlecht akzeptiert. Erst im Jahre 2009 wurde auf Grundlage von OpenType ein neues Format namens «WOFF» (Web Open Font Format) entwickelt. Dieses Format wurde sehr schnell von Browser-Herstellern und von Font-Anbietern akzeptiert, so dass heute Problemlos auf allen wichtigen Browsern der vom Gestalter gewünschte Font dynamisch in die Seite geladen werden kann.</p>\\n<h3>Web Safe Fonts (Systemfonts)</h3>\\n<p>Unter Systemfonts wird häufig eine Auswahl an Schriften verstanden, die zu einer sehr hohen Wahrscheinlichkeit auf dem Betriebssystem installiert sind, auf dem ein Browser eine Website darstellt. Somit ist der Browser in der Lage diesen Font zu verwenden und es muss kein zusätzlicher Font übertragen werden. Die Auswahl dieser Fonts ist sehr beschränkt und variiert stark von Betriebssystem zu Betriebssystem. Um dennoch die Gestaltung mehr oder weniger unter Kontrolle zu behalten, werden in einem CSS sogenannte Fallbacks angegeben. Das heisst, wenn eine Schrift nicht vorhanden ist, so kommt eine andere zum Einsatz.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel</h4>\\n<p>CSS-Definition mit Font-Fallbacks:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\np {\\n  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<p>Es wird versucht zuerst Arial einzusetzen. Wenn keine Arial vorhanden ist, soll Helvetica zum Einsatz kommen und sonst eine beliebige Serifenlose.</p>\\n<h3>Verbreitung und Vorteile von Webfonts</h3>\\n<p>Meist kommt bei Webfonts das WOFF (Web Open Font Format) zum Einsatz. Seit 2014 sind auch die besser komprimierten WOFF 2.0 Dateien im Gebrauch, die heute von allen modernen Browsern unterstützt werden. Auch ältere Browser können mit älteren Font-Formaten (EOT)  Schriften einbinden.\\nVerfügt man über eine Lizenz eines Webfonts, so kann diese Schrift dynamisch zur Seite hinzugeladen werden. Der Gestalter weiss somit, wie seine Seite aussehen wird und kann die Typografie vollständig kontrollieren.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Fallback</h4>\\n<p>Damit der Webfont von möglichst vielen Browsern gelesen werden kann, werden diverse Fallbacks definiert.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>CSS-Definition für Webfonts:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\n@font-face {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans';\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot'); /* IE9 */\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), /* IE6 - IE8 */\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff2') format('woff2'), /* Modern Browsers */\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff') format('woff'), /* OK Browsers */\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.ttf') format('truetype'); /* Safari, Android, iOS */\\n  font-weight: normal; <!–– ** ––>\\n  font-style: normal;\\n}\\n\\np {\\n  font-family: \\\"Open Sans\\\", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h4>Beispiel google-Fonts</h4>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans');\\n\\np {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Unicode Range</h3>\\n<p>Möchte man nur eine speziefische Auswahl an Buchstaben (Subset) eines Fonts von einer anderen Font-Datei beziehen, so kann dies mittels <code>unicode-range</code> gemacht werden. Dies ist vor allem nützlich, wenn wichtige Zeichen in einem Font fehlen (beispielsweise geschütztes schmales Leerzeichen) und von einer anderen Datei bezogen werden müssen.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel</h4>\\n<p>CSS-Definition mit <code>unicode-range</code> aus zwei font-faces:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\n@font-face {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans';\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot');\\n  src: url('opensans-reg-web.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff2') format('woff2'),\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.woff') format('woff'),\\n  url('opensans-reg-web.ttf') format('truetype');\\n  font-weight: normal;\\n  font-style: normal;\\n  unicode-range: U+000-5FF; /* Latin glyphs */  <!–– ** ––>\\n}\\n\\n@font-face {\\n  font-family: 'Open Sans';\\n  src: url('special-web.eot');\\n  src: url('special-web.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),\\n  url('special-web.woff2') format('woff2'),\\n  url('special-web.woff') format('woff'),\\n  url('special-web.ttf') format('truetype');\\n  font-weight: normal;\\n  font-style: normal;\\n  unicode-range: U+0061; /* overwrite for letter a */  <!–– ** ––>\\n}\\n\\np {\\n  font-family: \\\"Open Sans\\\", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h3>OpenType features</h3>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Links</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://helpx.adobe.com/typekit/using/open-type-syntax.html#ordn\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Übersicht über die OpenType-Features von Adobe</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/font-feature-settings/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Anwendung – css-tricks</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">MDN</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://blog.bramp.net/post/2018/01/21/google-font-features/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Google vs. Font Features</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n<p>Auch im Web sind OpenType features wie Ligaturen oder verschiedenen Zahlensets möglich.

Adobe, Google, Microsoft und Andere haben zugesagt diesen Standard bald in Ihre Software-Produkte zu integireren. Neben diversen eher technischen Erneuerungen ist vor allem die Möglichkeit für «Variable Fonts» für Gestalter heraus zu streichen. Mit dieser Funktion können Fonts mehrere so genannte Design-Achsen haben. Man kann also Fonts so einrichten, dass Sie zum Beispiel von ganz Light zu super Black stuffenlos (oder mit vom Designer gewählten Stufen) einstellbar sind. Aber auch andere Design-Achsen lassen sich frei vom Schriftdesinger bestimmen. Diese Technologie erinnert an die «Multiple master fonts» (1991), jedoch wird sich der neue Standard wohl besser verbreiten als die damalige Technologie.</p>\\n<h3>CSS und Web</h3>\\n<p>Im Moment werden Variable Fonts gerade in die Software-Produkte eingebaut. Erste Test-Versionen sind für Entwickler zugägnlich. Folgende CSS-Attribute sind vom Standard vorgesehen:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>font-weight</code> – Schriftstärke als Zahl von 1–999</li>\\n<li><code>font-stretch</code> – Schriftbreite in % (50% = Condesed, 200% Extended)</li>\\n<li><code>font-style</code> – Schriftlage zwischen -90° und +90°</li>\\n<li><code>font-optical-sizing</code> – Optische Schriftgrösen ein- oder ausschalten</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br>\\n<p>Daneben lassen sich aber auch weitere Werte-Achsen wie folgt definieren;</p>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<p>Hier wird jeweils eine Werte-Achse mit vier Buchstaben (vom Designer bestimmt) mit einem Wert angewandt.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"code\\\">\\n<pre>\\np {\\n    font-variation-settings: \\\"wdth\\\" 600, \\\"wght\\\" 200, \\\"opsz\\\" 48;\\n}\\n</pre>\\n</div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"fonts-finden-testen\\\">Fonts finden &amp; testen</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Mieten von Desktop-Fonts</h4>\\n<p>Auf fontstand.com können Desktop-Fonts gemietet werden. Dies ermöglicht Entwürfe dem Kunden vor zu legen, ohne den Font gekauft zu haben.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Fonts für Web- und Screendesign können von fast allen grossen und kleinen Font-Foundrys erworben werden. Es gibt vereinzelt Schriften, die (noch) nicht für den Web-Einsatz lizenziert werden können, dies ist jedoch eher die Ausnahme. Für Anwendungen ausserhalb des Webs – aber auf Screens – gibt es eher wenige Anbieter. So bietet zum Beispiel Linotype auch für eBooks, Apps und Server-Anwendungen Lizenzen. Diese Lizenztypen sind jedoch bei anderen Firmen oft nur mit Verhandlungen zu erwerben und es gibt keine standardisierten Prozesse.\\nDas Vorgehen zur Recherche von neuen Schriften unterscheidet sich nicht wesentlich vom finden von Schriften für den Print-Bereich. Sucht man eine Schrift, deren Name schon bekannt ist, so kann direkt zum Anbieter gesprungen werden. Ist man eher auf der Suche nach einem bestimmten Stil, kann eine Font-Plattform wie myfonts.com genutzt werden um ein entsprechendes Design zu finden.</p>\\n<h3>Testen</h3>\\n<p>Beim Suchen von Schriften ist es ratsam, die Schrift möglichst in einem Live-Preview auf die Tauglichkeit am Bildschirm zu prüfen. Deshalb können Fonts bei immer mehr Anbietern entweder auf der Seite getestet werden, oder aber Sie kooperieren mit Test-Platformen wie zum Beispiel typecast.com. Bei solch einem Dienst kann bereits vor dem Kauf geprüft werden, ob die Schrift bei gewünschter Anwendung, Grösse und Schriftmischung auf dem Screen funktioniert.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h3>Vor dem Kauf testen</h3>\\n<p>Auf typecast.com können Text-Layouts bereits vor dem Kauf einer Schrift definiert und editiert werden.\\nDies erleichtert die Wahl eines geeigneten Fonts und zudem kann dem Kunden bereits ein Eindruck der fertigen Site vermittelt werden.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"imageline\\\">\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/typecast.png\\\" alt=\\\"Fonts mit typecast.com testen\\\"></p>\\n</div>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"fontlizenzen\\\">Fontlizenzen</h2>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Mieten (pro Monat)</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.fonts.com/unlimited#pricing\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">fonts.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://typekit.com/plans\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Typekit</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Fonts einmalig kaufen</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.urwpp.de/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">→ URW++</a> (zeitlich beschränkt)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.fontshop.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">→ Fontshop</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>Views kaufen</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.linotype.com/de/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">→ linotype.com</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n</div>\\n<p>Es gibt grundsätzlich drei verschiedene Arten von kommerziellen Font-Lizenzen:</p>\\n<h3>Miet-Lizenzen</h3>\\n<p>Beim mieten von Lizenzen wird meist ein View-Volumen pro Monat gekauft unabhängig jedoch von der Anzahl der Fonts. So kann zum Beispiel bei fonts.com ein Account erworben werden, der 50 000 Pageviews pro Monat auf einer Domain erlaubt. Wird diese Zahl überschritten, muss auf ein höherer Preisplan gewechselt werden. Oft kann ein Account für diverse Projekte gleichzeitig verwendet werden. Die Fonts sind beim Anbieter gehostet.</p>\\n<h3>Einmalige Lizenzkosten</h3>\\n<p>Bei immer wenigen Anbietern kann eine Lizenz einmalig erworben werden. Bei einer solchen Lizenz wird diee Schrift meist auf dem eigenen Server installiert und der Schriftenanbieter vertraut darauf, dass der Käufer die Anzahl Views pro Monat, für die Lizenziert wurde, nicht überschritten wird.</p>\\n<h3>Kaufen von Views</h3>\\n<p>Es gibt Anbieter, die Views verkaufen. Das heisst, dass mit jedem Besuch einer Webseite mit dem Font das erworbene «Konto» um ein View reduziert wird. Somit muss die Schrift von Zeit zu Zeit wieder mit neuen Views aktiviert werden, so dass immer genügend Views vorhanden sind. Oder aber das Konto erneuert sich immer am Ende des Monats neu.</p>\\n<h3>Zeichensatz</h3>\\n<p>Wird die Schrift auf einer Seite eingesetzt, bei der viele Sprachen oder sonst spezielle Zeichen vorkommen, so ist es empfehlenswert zu Prüfen, ob die Schrift auch den nötigen Zeichensatz abdeckt. Auch OpenType-Features werden von den Schriftherstellern normalerweise vor dem Kauf angegeben.</p>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"freefonts-kommerzielle-fonts\\\">Freefonts – Kommerzielle Fonts</h2>\\n<p>Es gibt von diversen Font Foundries, Firmen und Enthusiasten qualitativ sehr hochwertige und gute Schriften, die frei verfügbar sind. Dabei gibt es diverse Abstufungen. Es gibt ganze Schriftfamilien, die frei sind, dann gibt es Schriftfamilien, bei denen einzelne Schnitte frei sind, oder es gibt Fonts, bei denen ein gewisser Zeichenumfang frei ist. Damit nicht bei den einzelnen Stellen im Web nach den Fonts gesucht werden muss, empfiehlt es sich, Portale zu verwenden, die einem die verschiedenen Fonts sortiert präsentieren oder eine schnelle Suche ermöglichen. Auch bieten solche Portale zum Teil die Möglichkeit, die Fonts gleich von deren Server zu laden (google Fonts) oder gewisse Konvertierungen für den Webgebrauch (fontsquirrel) zu erledigen.\\nDie benötige Fontlizenz für eine Website sollte mit dem Kunden geklärt werden und bereits in der Offerte sollte geklärt sein, wer die Lizenz zu erwerben hat.</p>\\n<h3>Kunde oder Agentur</h3>\\n<p>Aus finanzieller Überlegung kann es attraktiv sein, die Schriftlizenzen für alle Kunden über ein Konto der Agentur zu kaufen. So können die Kosten auf die verschiedenen Webprojekte umgelegt werden. Dies hat jedoch auch den Nachteil, dass die Agentur die Verantwortung gegenüber dem Kunden hat, den Account zu bezahlen und pflegen.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h4>fonts.com</h4>\\n<p>Im nebenstehenden Beispiel sieht man, dass für $32 pro Monat eine Million Views für beliebig viele Domains erworben werden kann.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./img/fontcom_subscription.png\\\" alt=\\\"Abonnement für fonts.com\\\"></p>\\n<div class='header'></div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"iconfonts\\\">Iconfonts</h2>\\n<p>Icons werden auf Websites oft verwendet um Inhalte schneller und einfacher zugänglich zu machen. Aus technischer Sicht ist es relativ einfach – für einen Programmierer – diese Icons in einen Font zu konvertieren. Zudem haben solche Icons den Vorteil, dass Sie auf vielen Betriebsystemen und Browsern funktionieren und vektorbasiert aufgebaut sind. Als Nachteil ist zu beklagen, dass für die Accessibility (Menschen mit Behinderung einen Zugang ermöglichen) es oftmals keine gute Idee ist, die Icons mit Schrift zu machen, da die Zeichen dann als Inhalt verstanden werden und zum Beispiel Screen-Reader damit Probleme haben können.</p>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<div class=\\\"margin\\\">\\n<h3>Iconfonts optimieren</h3>\\n<p>Fontello.com bietet die Möglichkeit aus diversen freien Icon-Fonts sich die nötigen Icons zu suchen und dann einen eignenen Icon-Font daraus zu erstellen.

Aber immer führende Nullstellen bei den Minuten.</p>\\n<h3>Schaltsekunde</h3>\\n<p>Da die Erde leicht langsamer um die eigene Achse rotiert, als die definierte Anzahl Sekunden (86400) in einem Tag (Sekunde zu schnell definiert), wird mit «Schaltsekunden» diese Abweichung kompensiert.</p>\\n<p>Der «Internationale Dienst für Erdrotation und Referenzsysteme» legt fest, wann eine zusätzliche Schaltsekunde eingefügt werden muss. Dies ist in unregelmässigen abständen und an unterschiedlichen Daten (meist 30. Juni oder 31. Dezember) der Fall.</p>\\n<h4>Beispiel</h4>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-md\\\">31.12.2011 23:59:59\\n31.12.2011 23:59:60 ← Schaltsekunde\\n01.01.2012 00:00:00\\n</code></pre>\\n<br>\\n<p>Es gibt diverse Probleme mit Computer-Systemen und Schaltsekunden. <a href=\\\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/look-before-you-leap-december-31-2016-leap-second-on-aws/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Einige Firmen</a> sind dazu übergegangen, die Schaltsekunde über einen Tag zu verteilen um keine einundsechzigste Sekunde in einer Stunde haben zu müssen.</p>\\n<h3>Zeitzonen</h3>\\n<p>Durch die Erdrotation werden verschiedene Regionen der Welt zu unterschiedlichen Zeiten der Sonne zugewandt (Tag). Die Zeitmessung wird jedoch meist daran gerichtet, dass man um Mittag den höchsten Sonnenstand möchte. Somit muss die Abweichung über so genannte Zeitzonen kompensiert werden:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/World_Time_Zones_Map.png\\\" alt=\\\"Zeitzonen\\\">\\nQuelle: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Time_Zones_Map.png\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Wikipedia</a></p>\\n<p>Einige Regionen und politische Einheiten sind trotz grosser Ausdehnung in den Längengraden als einheitliche Zeitzone zusammengefasst. So ist zum Beispiel ganz China in der gleichen Zeitzone (UTC+8). Dadurch ergibt sich beim Grenzüberschritt nach Afganistan der grösste «Zeitsprung» der Erde von -3.5 Stunden.</p>\\n<p>Es kann vorkommen, dass Zeitzonen «unlogisch» und schnell ändern. Beispiel hierfür ist Australien, welches im Jahr 2000 für die dauer der Olymischen Sommerspiele und im Jahr 2006 für die «Commonwealth Games» ihre Zeitzonen vereinheitlichte.</p>\\n<h3>UTC – Coordinated Universal Time</h3>\\n<p>Seit 1884 wird der <a href=\\\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullmeridian\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Nullmeridian</a> basierend auf der Ortschaft Greenwich (England) verwendet um die Zeitmessung international standardisiert zu koordinieren.

Somit haben viele Server UTC als Standard. Bei Desktop-Computern wird meist mit Geolokation versucht die richtige Zeitzone zu finden.</p>\\n<h3>Sommerzeit</h3>\\n<p>In einigen Regionen der Welt wird in den Sommermonaten eine Sommerzeit (Daylight saving time – DST) eingeführt. Diese wird meist eine Stunde vor der üblichen Zeit gestellt. So ist die mitteleuropäische Zeit (MEZ) in den Wintermonaten UTC+1 und in den Sommermonaten UTC+2.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"margin compact\\\">\\n<h4>Schweiz</h4>\\n<p>Am 28. Mai 1978 wurde in einer Volksabstimmung (Referendum) beschlossen, dass man sich nicht mit der Sommerzeit den Nachbarstaaten anschliesst.

Oktober 2018 beschlossen, dass die Winterzeit am Folgetag nicht mehr zur Anwendung kommen wird. Dies führte zu diversen Problemen, da die Umstellung sehr kurzfristig war.</p>\\n<h4>Abschaffung in der EU</h4>\\n<p>Das EU-Parlament entschied im März 2019, dass nur noch bis 2021 eine Sommerzeitumstellung erfolgen soll. Danach steht es den Mitgliedstaaten frei ob sie in Normal- oder Sommerzeit ihre weiter fahren. Es bleibt zu hoffen, dass die Staaten sich einigen können, so dass es weiterhin eine grosse geschlossene Zeitzone (MEZ) in der EU gibt.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"datum-kalender\\\">Datum &amp; Kalender</h2>\\n<p>Der <a href=\\\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorianischer_Kalender\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">gregorianische Kalender</a> ist weltweit der meist gebrauchte Kalender und wurde im Jahr 1582 von Papst Gregor XIII verordnet. Dabei hat das Jahr (Umlauf der Erde um die Sonne) im Durchschnitt etwa 365,25 Tage und diese werden auf 12 Monate verteilt. Die Schaltjahre haben 366 Tage, sonstige Jahre werden mit 365 Tagen geführt.</p>\\n<h3>Regeln für Schaltjahre</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>1. Regel: Jahreszahl durch vier ganzzahlig teilbaren = Schaltjahr</li>\\n<li>2. Regel: Jahreszahl durch 100 ganzzahlig teilbaren = kein Schaltjahr (1. Regel überlegen)</li>\\n<li>3. Regel: Jahreszahl durch 400 ganzzahlig teilbaren = Schaltjahr (2. Regel überlegen)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Jahr-2000-Problem</h3>\\n<p>Im Jahr 2000 gab es zwei Probleme; Das kleinere Problem war, dass diverse Software das Schaltjahr im Jahr 2000 nicht korrekt berechnet hatten und fälschlich keine Schaltjahr annahmen. Das grössere Problem war, dass teils Jahreszahlen nur zweistellig abgespeichert wurden. Also anstatt zum Beispiel 1999 wurde nur 99 abgespeichert. Beim Jahreswechsel wurde somit neu 00 abgespeichert, was anstatt 2000 als 1900 interpretiert wurde.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"numerische-notation-von-daten\\\">Numerische Notation von Daten</h2>\\n<p>Bei der numerischen Schreibweise für ein Datum gibt es diverse Standards.

Dabei handelt es sich um eine Ganzzahl (signed integer) welche die vergangenen Sekunden seit 1. Januar 1970 um 0:00 Uhr räpresentiert. Die Zahl kann ein Vorzeichen haben, also auch einen Minus-Bereich abdecken und somit Ereignisse vor 1970 repräsentieren.</p>\\n<h3>Beispiele</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>31. Dezember 1999, 23:59:59 = 946 684 799 000</li>\\n<li>22. November 1963, 18:30:00 = –192 778 200</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Jahr-2038-Problem</h3>\\n<p>Im Januar 2038 wird die Sekundenzahl so gross werden, dass die Zahl nicht mehr mit 32 Bit (vorzeichenbehaftete 32-Bit-Ganzzahl) gespeichert werden kann. Einige Computer-Systeme speichern jedoch noch immer in 32 Bit ab. Diese Systeme müssen bis spätestens dahin umgestellt werden. Neuere Systeme speichern Timestamps als 62-Bit-Wert ab.

Je nach Inhalt, Umfang und Verwendungszweck können verschiedene Konzepte angewendet werden. Nicht alleinig der Inhalt, sondern auch das Anzeigegerät kann eine entscheidende Rolle spielen, wie dies geschehen sollte. So wird bei einem Smartphone der Zugang durch einen kleinen Bildschirm über eine Fingersteuerung gewährleistet, während man bei einem Desktop-Computer mit der Maus auf einem grossem Bildschirm navigiert.</p>\\n<h3>Strukturieren der Inhalte in Seiten</h3>\\n<p>Die meisten Websites gliedern Inhalte über Seiten.

Sie können als Filterkriterien in der Textsuche verwendet werden, indem der Text mit dem Muster des regulären Ausdrucks abgeglichen wird. So können Regeln definiert werden, die wesentlich flexibler sind als eine sture Suche nach einer fest vorgegebenen Zeichenfolge. In menschlicher Sprache ausgedrückt könnte zum Beispiel folgendes Suchmuster (Pattern) definiert werden: Suche alle Worte, die mit dem Zeichen <code>A</code> beginnen und dem Zeichen <code>r</code> enden (RegEx: <code>\\\\bA[^ ]*r</code>).</p>\\n<h3>Geschichte</h3>\\n<p>Reguläre Ausdrücke wurden 1956 vom Mathematiker Stephen Cole Kleene erstmalig beschrieben. Diese mathematische Notation (reguläre Mengen) entstammt der theoretischen Informatik und es handelt sich dabei um eine formale Sprache – also eine abstrakte Sprache, bei der nicht die Kommunikation im Vordergrund steht, sondern die mathematische Verwendung.</p>\\n<h3>Reguläre Ausdrücke, RegEx, GREP?</h3>\\n<p>Es gibt diverse Begriffe, die stellvertretend für reguläre Ausdrücke verwendet werden. Häufig wird auch in der deutschen Sprache der englische Begriff «regular expressions» benutzt. Alternativ auch die Kurzform davon; «RegEx». Der Begriff GREP (auch: grep, Grep) steht für «global/regular expression/print» und entspringt dem Kommando <code>g/re/p</code> des Unix-Standardeditors «ed». Alle diese Begriffe lassen sich synonym verwenden und bezeichnen das selbe.</p>\\n<h3>Bedeutung &amp; Implementierungen</h3>\\n<p>Fast alle Programmiersprachen und Betriebssysteme (Konsole/Terminal) unterstützen heute reguläre Ausdrücke und seit den 1960er Jahren werden diese oft für Mustererkennungen (Suchbegriffe) in Texteditoren und zur lexikalischen Analyse in diversen Bereichen der digitalen Datenverarbeitung eingesetzt. Je nach verwendeter Implementierung (Programm) können kleine Abweichungen in der Verwendung, im Umfang oder der Notation auftauchen. JavaScript unterstützt Reguläre Ausdrücke seit <a href=\\\"https://www-archive.mozilla.org/js/language/E262-3.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ECMAScript 3</a> aus dem Jahr 1999 und seit dem weiter entwickelt.\\nReguläre ausdrücke werden auch in der Bioinformatik eingesetzt. Ein Beispiel aus Wikipedia zeigt die Beschreibung eines Proteinmotivs:\\n<code>W-x(9,11)-[VFY]-[FYW]-x(6,7)-[GSTNE]-[GSTQCR]-[FYW]-R-S-A-P</code></p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"suchen\\\">Suchen</h2>\\n<h3>Zeichen und Platzhalter</h3>\\n<p>Als Zeichenliterale bezeichnen wir ein oder mehrere Buchstaben, die in einem Suchmuster enthalten sind. Der Buchstabe <code>a</code> – als Beispiel – findet nur den Buchstaben <code>a</code> und ansonsten keine weiteren Zeichen. Zusätzlich zu den expliziten Literalen gibt es noch den Punkt (<code>.</code>) als Platzhalterzeichen. Der Punkt findet jedes beliebige Zeichen. Möchte man einen Punkt suchen, so wird dieser mit einem sogenannten Escape-Zeichen (<code>.</code>) eingegeben. Neben den expliziten Zeichen gibt es noch weitere Platzhalter, welche eine spezielle Bedeutung haben. Hier einige Beispiele:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\d</code></td>\\n<td>Ziffer</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\w</code></td>\\n<td>Buchstabe &amp; Ziffer</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\s</code></td>\\n<td>Leerraumzeichen</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\b</code></td>\\n<td>Wortgrenze*</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>$</code></td>\\n<td>Ende der Linie*</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>^</code></td>\\n<td>Anfang der Linie*</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Findet eine Position in einer Zeichenkette (auch: zero-width, zero-length)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n<th>Erklärung</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>a</code></td>\\n<td>Hallo.</td>\\n<td>a</td>\\n<td>Das <code>a</code> ist ein Zeichen ohne spezieller Funktion und wird somit auch im Text gefunden</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\x{0061}</code></td>\\n<td>Hallo.</td>\\n<td>a</td>\\n<td>Zeichen können auch als Unicode-Wert angegeben werden (<code>U+0060</code> = <code>a</code>)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>.</code></td>\\n<td>Ja.</td>\\n<td>J, a, .</td>\\n<td>Der Punkt dient als Platzhalter für alle Zeichen. Somit werden alle Zeichen gefunden.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>.auch</code></td>\\n<td>Rauch<br/>Bauch<br/>auch</td>\\n<td>Rauch<br/>Bauch</td>\\n<td>Das Platzhalter Zeichen (<code>.</code>) findet sowohl ein <code>R</code>, wie auch ein <code>B</code>. Das Wort <code>auch</code> wird jedoch nicht gefunden, da das Platzhalterzeichen nicht gefüllt werden kann.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\.</code></td>\\n<td>Hallo.</td>\\n<td>.</td>\\n<td>Möchte man lediglich einen Punkt suchen, so wird dieser als <code>\\\\.</code> gesucht.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>\\\\\\\\</code></td>\\n<td>\\\\o/</td>\\n<td>\\\\</td>\\n<td>Back-Slash wird mit <code>\\\\\\\\</code> gefunden.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Eckige Klammern, Bereiche und Negation</h3>\\n<p>Eine Auflistung von alternativen Zeichen (Zeichenauswahl/Zeichenklasse) wird in Eckigen Klammern angegeben. Möchte man zum Beispiel nach einem <code>a</code> oder <code>b</code> suchen, so kann man dies als <code>[ab]</code> ausdrücken. Sollen ganze Mengen von Zeichen angegeben werden, so kann dies auch über eine <code>von–bis</code> Schreibweise getan werden. Also zum Beispiel findet <code>[a-d]</code> die Buchstaben <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code> und <code>d</code> (positive Zeichenklasse). Ebenso lässt sich ein Zeichenauswahl definieren, die alle Zeichen ausser die angegebenen enthält. So umschreibt der Ausdruck <code>[^A-Z]</code> zum Beispiel alle Zeichen ausser die Zeichen <code>A</code> bis <code>Z</code> (negierte Zeichenauswahl/Zeichenklasse).</p>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n<th>Erklärung</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>[a-zA-Z]</code></td>\\n<td>Hallo?</td>\\n<td>H, a, l, l, o</td>\\n<td>Findet alle Klein- und Grossbuchstaben nicht aber weitere Zeichen wie zum Beispiel das Fragezeichen.</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Anwendungsbeispiel Platzhalter</h3>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>Me.er</code></td>\\n<td>Meier<br/>Meyer<br/>Maier <br/>Meder</td>\\n<td>Meier<br/>Meyer<br/>×<br/>×</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Anwendungsbeispiel Zeichenklassen</h3>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>M[ae][yi]er</code></td>\\n<td>Mayer<br/>Maier<br/>Meyer<br/>Meier<br/>Meder</td>\\n<td>Mayer<br/>Maier<br/>Meyer<br/>Meier<br/>×</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>M[ae][^yi]er</code></td>\\n<td>Mayer<br/>Maier<br/>Meyer<br/>Meier<br/>Meder</td>\\n<td>×<br/>×<br/>×<br/>×<br/>Meder</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n</div>\\n<h3>Wiederholungsfaktoren</h3>\\n<p>Wiederholungsfaktoren – auch Quantoren genannt – geben an, wie oft ein Ausdruck gefunden werden kann.

So findet ein Ausdruck wie <code>a.*z</code> alle Stellen die mit <code>a</code> beginnen und mit <code>z</code> enden ungeachtet dessen, ob vor dem letzten <code>z</code> weitere <code>z</code> stehen. Dieses Verhalten kann mit einem Fragezeichen (<code>?</code>) hinter einem Quantor unterbunden werden (Bsp: <code>.*?</code>).</p>\\n<div class=\\\"grid fullsize\\\">\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>RegEx</th>\\n<th>Text</th>\\n<th>Findet</th>\\n<th>Erklärung</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>h.*r</code></td>\\n<td>horrortheater</td>\\n<td>horrortheater</td>\\n<td>Findet im Wort die längste Entsprechung, welche nicht <code>hor</code>, nicht <code>horr</code> und auch nicht <code>horror</code> ist.</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>h.*?r</code></td>\\n<td>horrortheater</td>\\n<td>hor<br/>heater</td>\\n<td>Findet nun die kürzeste Entsprechung (<code>hor</code>).
